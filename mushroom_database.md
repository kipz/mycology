## Safety Guidelines

### Real-World Mushroom Foraging

**NEVER eat a mushroom unless you are 100% certain of its identity.** Many edible mushrooms have deadly lookalikes. This mod is educational but simplified - real mushroom identification requires:

- Expert knowledge or supervision
- Spore prints
- Microscopy
- Multiple identification sources
- Understanding of seasonal and habitat variations

**Golden Rules:**
1. When in doubt, throw it out
2. Never rely on a single identification feature
3. Avoid white Amanitas entirely
4. Cook all wild mushrooms thoroughly
5. Try new species in small amounts first
6. Some people react badly to generally edible species

## Mushroom Entries (A-Z)

### Amethyst Deceiver
*Laccaria amethystina*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and coniferous woodlands

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Amethyst Deceiver is a small to medium-sized mushroom that fruits abundantly in woodlands during autumn. Its most striking feature is its vivid purple to amethyst coloration when young and fresh, though this "deceives" foragers as it fades significantly with age, becoming buff to pale lilac. The cap is 2-6cm across, convex becoming flatter with a slightly depressed center. The gills are thick, widely spaced, and the same purple color as the cap. The stem is slender (4-10cm tall, 3-8mm wide), fibrous, and often twisted, colored purple throughout.

This mushroom grows in both deciduous and coniferous forests, often forming small troops in mossy areas or among leaf litter. It has a mycorrhizal association with various trees including oak, beech, and pine. While edible, it's not considered choice due to its thin flesh and somewhat tough texture. The purple color fades significantly when cooked. It's generally safe to identify as there are few purple mushrooms in UK woodlands, though the faded specimens can be confused with the similar Deceiver (L. laccata).

**Lookalikes:**
- **Deceiver** (Laccaria laccata) - Similar but orange-brown
- Faded specimens can be difficult to distinguish from common brown woodland mushrooms

### Artist's Bracket
*Ganoderma applanatum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Medicinal Only
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead or dying hardwood trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A (medicinal only)
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None (used in crafting)

**Identification:**
Artist's Bracket is a large, perennial polypore fungus that forms impressive hoof-shaped or semi-circular brackets on dead or dying hardwood trees, particularly beech, oak, and sycamore. The fruiting body can grow 10-50cm across and persist for many years, adding a new pore layer each season. The upper surface is hard, woody, and concentrically zoned with browns and grays, often with a crusty texture. The margin is typically white when actively growing.

The underside features a white to cream pore surface that instantly bruises dark brown when scratched - this characteristic gives the fungus its common name, as the bruising can be used to create artwork or notes. The pore surface oxidizes to brown within minutes of being touched. The flesh is brown, corky, and extremely tough. This fungus is too woody to be edible but has medicinal properties similar to Reishi. It's a white rot fungus that breaks down lignin in wood.

In traditional Chinese medicine, this species (known as Ling Chih) has been used for immune system support and anti-inflammatory purposes. The spores are brown and produced in vast quantities, often accumulating as a rusty-brown dust around the bracket.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Reishi** (Ganoderma lucidum) - More kidney-shaped, lacquered red-brown surface
- Other Ganoderma species - Require microscopy for certain identification

### Bay Bolete
*Imleria badia*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous and mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Bay Bolete is a highly regarded edible bolete with a distinctive bay-brown to chestnut-brown cap that gives it its common name. The cap is 5-15cm across, hemispherical when young, expanding to convex or flat. The surface is smooth to slightly velvety and can be sticky when wet. The pore surface underneath is pale yellow when young, becoming greenish-yellow with age, and characteristically bruises blue-green when touched or damaged.

The stem is 5-12cm tall and 1-3cm thick, cylindrical or slightly club-shaped, colored similarly to the cap or paler. The flesh is pale yellowish-white, firm in young specimens, turning slightly blue when cut (though less dramatically than many other boletes). It has a pleasant mild smell and taste. Bay Bolete forms mycorrhizal associations with conifers, particularly Scots pine, but can also be found with beech and oak in mixed woodland.

This is considered an excellent edible mushroom, with firm flesh and good flavor. **Important:** Like all wild mushrooms, it must be cooked thoroughly for at least 15 minutes before eating - never consume raw. The tubes should be removed from older specimens as they become slimy when cooked. Young, firm specimens are best for eating.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Porcini/Cep** (Boletus edulis) - Paler cap, white reticulation on stem
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - Smaller, more yellow-brown, less blue bruising

### Beech Woodwart
*Hypoxylon fragiforme*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round
- **Habitat:** Dead beech wood

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Beech Woodwart is a hard, small, flask-shaped fungus that forms dense clusters of reddish-brown to blackish "beads" or "warts" on dead beech branches and logs. Each fruitbody is 5-20mm across, roughly spherical when young, becoming more irregular with age. The surface starts brick-red to reddish-brown when young and fresh, darkening to almost black with age. When mature, the entire surface is covered with tiny ostioles (pore-like openings) through which spores are released.

This fungus is a pyrenomycete, producing its spores inside tiny flask-shaped structures (perithecia) embedded in the stroma. When the surface is scratched or broken, it often releases a cloud of dark spores. The interior tissue is zoned concentrically in white and black layers. Beech Woodwart is specific to beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) and is one of the most common fungi found on dead beech wood in the UK.

It plays an important ecological role as a decomposer of deadwood but has no culinary or medicinal value. The hard, woody texture makes it completely inedible. However, it's an interesting species for identification practice and understanding fungal ecology.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Cramp Balls** (Daldinia concentrica) - Larger, more spherical, on ash wood
- Other Hypoxylon species - Require microscopy for certain identification

### Beechwood Sickener
*Russula nobilis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Poisonous
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Autumn (August-October)
- **Habitat:** Under beech trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison I (400 ticks), Confusion I (600 ticks)

**Identification:**
Beechwood Sickener is a medium-sized Russula that fruits exclusively under beech trees, hence its common name. The cap is 5-10cm across, convex to flat, colored bright red to cherry red with a paler margin. The cap surface is smooth and slightly greasy when moist, with skin that peels easily partway toward the center. The gills are white to cream, closely spaced, and brittle - a characteristic feature of all Russula species.

The stem is 5-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical, and pure white, sometimes flushed pink at the base. The flesh is white, firm, and brittle, snapping cleanly like chalk. **Critical identification feature:** The taste is acrid and peppery (though you should never swallow when taste-testing - immediately spit out). This hot, burning taste is the key characteristic that distinguishes inedible Russulas from edible ones.

Like its relative the Sickener (R. emetica), this species causes severe gastrointestinal distress if eaten, including vomiting and diarrhea - hence the common name. While not lethal, it causes very unpleasant symptoms. The mycorrhizal association is specific to beech (Fagus sylvatica), making it a reliable indicator species.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Sickener** (Russula emetica) - Similar but found with conifers
- **Blackening Brittlegill** (Russula nigricans) - Larger, blackens with age
- Edible red Russulas - These have mild taste, not acrid

**Warning:** Never eat a red Russula unless you are absolutely certain of the species and have confirmed mild taste.

### Beefsteak Fungus
*Fistulina hepatica*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Late summer to autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Oak and sweet chestnut trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Beefsteak Fungus is one of the most distinctive bracket fungi due to its remarkable resemblance to a cut of raw meat. The fruiting body is 7-30cm across, tongue or fan-shaped, attached to the tree by a short lateral stem. The upper surface is reddish-brown to liver-colored with a rough, slightly sticky texture. The underside has cream-colored tubes (pores) that are unusual in being separate from each other rather than fused - this is a unique identifying characteristic among UK polypores.

The most striking feature is its flesh, which is thick, soft, and juicy with a meat-like texture. When cut, it oozes a blood-red liquid and shows marbled streaks like raw steak. Young specimens are more palatable, though the flesh is acidic and can be sharp-tasting. The acidity mellows somewhat with cooking. This fungus grows almost exclusively on oak (Quercus) and occasionally sweet chestnut (Castanea), usually on living trees where it causes brown rot of the heartwood.

While edible, Beefsteak Fungus is not highly rated due to its acidic, sour taste. Young specimens can be sliced thinly and used as a meat substitute or in salads, where the tartness is appreciated. The acidity content means it should be eaten in moderation. Some foragers soak it in milk or salt water to reduce acidity before cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the combination of meat-like appearance, bleeding red juice, and separate tubes makes this unmistakable.

### Birch Polypore
*Fomitopsis betulina*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Medicinal Only
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead or dying birch trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A (medicinal only)
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None (used in crafting)

**Identification:**
Birch Polypore is a distinctive bracket fungus found exclusively on birch trees (Betula species), making it one of the easiest fungi to identify with certainty. The fruiting body is 5-30cm across, kidney or hoof-shaped, with a smooth, rounded upper surface that is pale brown to gray-brown, sometimes with a slight bloom. The underside is white to cream with tiny round pores (4-5 per mm). Young specimens have a rounded, bulbous appearance, becoming more bracket-like with age.

The flesh is white, corky when fresh, becoming very hard and brittle when dried. The fungus is annual or short-lived perennial. A key feature is the distinct separation layer between the cap and stem - the cap can often be easily removed from the tree, leaving the stem attached. This fungus is a white rot species that accelerates the decay of dead birch wood.

Historically, Birch Polypore has been used for medicinal purposes - it was found with Ötzi the Iceman, suggesting use dating back at least 5,300 years. Modern research has shown it contains compounds with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiparasitic properties. Traditionally, it was used to sharpen razors (hence the alternative name "Razor Strop Fungus") and to treat stomach ailments.

**Medicinal Uses:**
- Made into tea for digestive issues
- Anti-inflammatory properties
- Traditional wound dressing
- Antimicrobial effects

**Lookalikes:**
None on birch - this is absolutely specific to birch trees and unmistakable in its habitat.

### Bitter Oysterling
*Panellus stipticus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Poisonous (Inedible)
- **Toxicity:** Mild
- **Season:** Year-round
- **Habitat:** Dead hardwood, especially oak and beech

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Weakness I (200 ticks)

**Identification:**
Bitter Oysterling is a small, tough bracket or fan-shaped mushroom that grows in dense overlapping clusters on dead hardwood stumps and branches. Each cap is 1-4cm across, kidney to shell-shaped, with a lateral attachment. The upper surface is pale brown to cinnamon-brown, finely hairy to velvety, often with a zoned or wrinkled texture. The gills are closely spaced, pale buff to cinnamon, running down to the point of attachment.

The stem, when present, is very short and lateral. The flesh is thin, tough, and leathery. **Critical feature:** The taste is intensely bitter (though never swallow when testing - spit out immediately). This extreme bitterness makes it completely inedible and causes the common name. Interestingly, some North American populations of this fungus are bioluminescent - the gills glow green in the dark - though UK specimens rarely show this feature.

This fungus fruits year-round but is most abundant in autumn and winter. It plays an ecological role as a decomposer of hardwood, particularly oak and beech. While not seriously toxic, the bitter compounds can cause gastric upset if eaten, and the tough texture would make it unpalatable regardless.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Oyster Mushroom** (Pleurotus ostreatus) - Much larger, soft flesh, mild taste, grows in different seasons
- Other small Pleurotus species - Soft, edible, not bitter

**Warning:** Always taste-test suspect oyster mushrooms (spit out) - the intense bitterness instantly distinguishes this inedible species.

### Black Trumpet
*Craterellus cornucopioides*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed deciduous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Black Trumpet, also known as Horn of Plenty or Trumpet of the Dead, is a highly prized edible mushroom despite its somewhat ominous common names. The fruiting body is 3-12cm tall, deeply funnel or trumpet-shaped with a hollow interior that extends all the way through to the base. The color ranges from dark grey-brown to almost black on the upper, inner surface, while the outer surface (which would be the underside) is grey and slightly wrinkled or veined rather than having true gills or pores.

The flesh is thin, elastic, and breaks cleanly when pulled. The margin is wavy and irregular. Black Trumpets grow scattered or in troops in mixed deciduous woodland, particularly with oak, beech, and hazel. They have a mycorrhizal relationship with these trees. **Challenge:** Despite being relatively common, they are extremely difficult to spot due to their dark color camouflaging perfectly against leaf litter and dark forest floors.

This mushroom is considered a gourmet delicacy with an intense, rich, smoky flavor. It dries exceptionally well and the flavor intensifies with drying - dried Black Trumpets can be crumbled into soups, stews, and sauces as a seasoning. Fresh specimens can be sautéed in butter. There are no poisonous lookalikes, making this a safe mushroom for beginners once you learn to spot it.

**Foraging Tips:**
- Look for them in the same spots year after year
- They often grow in the same location as chanterelles
- Easier to spot after rain when they darken further
- Check mossy areas and hollows

### Blackening Waxcap
*Hygrocybe conica*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Poisonous
- **Toxicity:** Mild
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland and lawns

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison I (200 ticks)

**Identification:**
Blackening Waxcap is a striking grassland mushroom with a distinctive and diagnostic characteristic - it turns black when damaged or with age. The cap is 2-6cm across, conical to bell-shaped, rarely expanding flat. When fresh, it's brightly colored in shades of yellow, orange, or red - often a brilliant scarlet-red. The surface is smooth and greasy (waxy), giving the waxcap group their name. The gills are yellow to orange, free from the stem, and relatively thick and widely spaced.

The stem is 4-9cm tall, cylindrical, hollow, colored yellow-orange, and often twisted. **Diagnostic feature:** All parts of the mushroom turn jet black when bruised, handled, or with age. This blackening reaction happens within minutes to hours and is unmistakable. The flesh is thin, yellowish, and fragile, with no distinctive smell but a slightly unpleasant taste.

This species grows in unimproved grassland, lawns, and parks - habitats that haven't been heavily fertilized. It's an indicator species for high-quality grassland fungal communities. While not seriously poisonous, it causes gastric upset and is considered inedible. Some sources suggest it may be mildly toxic. The blackening feature makes it easy to identify and avoid.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other brightly colored waxcaps - None turn black when damaged
- **Scarlet Waxcap** (Hygrocybe coccinea) - Scarlet red, does NOT blacken

**Warning:** While most waxcaps are edible, this one is an exception. Never eat mushrooms that blacken dramatically.

### Blusher
*Amanita rubescens*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (when cooked - toxic raw!)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None (when cooked)

**Identification:**
The Blusher is a medium to large Amanita species that gets its name from the characteristic wine-red or pinkish flush that appears when the flesh is damaged or affected by insects. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially globose, expanding to convex and finally flat. The color is reddish-brown to fawn-brown, typically covered with pinkish-grey to grey-brown warts (remnants of the universal veil). The cap margin is not striated.

The gills are white, crowded, and free from the stem. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-3cm thick, whitish with a pinkish flush, especially where damaged. It has a ring (annulus) that is large, pendant, and white with slight striations on the upper surface. The base is bulbous with irregular rings or warts rather than a distinct volva sac. **Critical features:** The flesh bruises reddish, particularly where maggots have been feeding. The stem base often shows wine-red staining.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:** The Blusher is TOXIC when raw, containing the toxin hemolytic hemolysins. It MUST be cooked thoroughly (boiling or frying for at least 15 minutes) to destroy these toxins. Once properly cooked, it's considered a good edible. However, due to its membership in the Amanita genus (which includes the deadly Death Cap and Destroying Angel), extreme caution and expert identification are essential. **Beginners should avoid all Amanitas.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Panther Cap** (Amanita pantherina) - DEADLY. Grey-brown, pure white ring, marginate volva, does NOT blush red
- **Grey Spotted Amanita** (A. spissa) - Similar but darker, grey staining, not edible
- **Death Cap** (A. phalloides) - DEADLY. Greenish cap, white gills, volva sac

**Warning:** Never eat any Amanita unless you are absolutely certain of identification. When in doubt, throw it out.

### Bovine Bolete
*Suillus bovinus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Pine woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Bovine Bolete is a small to medium-sized bolete with a somewhat dull appearance compared to its more prized relatives. The cap is 3-10cm across, convex to flat, colored pale yellow-brown to orange-brown or cinnamon, with a smooth surface that becomes very slimy in wet weather. The pore surface is large-pored (compound pores), initially pale yellow, becoming darker greenish-yellow to olive with age. The pores do not bruise blue.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 0.5-1.5cm thick, equal or slightly swollen at the base, colored similarly to the cap. There is no ring, and the surface is smooth. The flesh is pale yellow, soft and often water-logged, with a faint fruity smell. The taste is mild to slightly acidic. Bovine Bolete forms mycorrhizal associations exclusively with pine trees (Pinus species), particularly Scots pine, often growing in dense troops.

While edible, Bovine Bolete is generally not highly rated due to its soft, watery texture and bland flavor. The slimy cap skin should be removed before cooking. It's best used in mixed mushroom dishes rather than on its own. Young specimens are preferable as older ones become soggy. Not considered choice, but safe and harmless. Often appears alongside the more desirable Slippery Jack.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Slippery Jack** (Suillus luteus) - Has a ring on stem, brown cap
- **Larch Bolete** (Suillus grevillei) - Golden yellow, ring present, with larch

**Additional Images:** [First Nature - Bovine Bolete](https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/suillus-bovinus.php)

### Brown Birch Bolete
*Leccinum scabrum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** With birch trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Brown Birch Bolete is a medium to large bolete found exclusively in association with birch trees (Betula species). The cap is 5-15cm across, hemispherical to convex, eventually flattening. The cap color ranges from grey-brown to dark brown or almost black, with a smooth to slightly felty texture. The pore surface is white when young, becoming cream to pale brown with age, bruising slightly greyish-brown when damaged. The tubes are long and deeply depressed around the stem apex.

The stem is distinctive: 8-20cm tall, 1-3cm thick, white to pale grey, and covered with small dark grey to black scales (scabers) that roughen the surface - this scaly stem is a diagnostic feature. The stem is often slightly swollen at the base but lacks a bulb. The flesh is white, soft, and does not change color when cut (or only very slightly). The flesh tends to become water-logged and spongy with age.

Brown Birch Bolete is edible but not highly regarded due to its soft, watery texture and bland flavor. The flesh becomes soggy when cooked and can make dishes watery. It's best used when young and firm, with the tubes removed from older specimens. Must be cooked thoroughly. The mushroom discolors to grey-black when cooked, which is unattractive but harmless. Often appears in large numbers when conditions are favorable.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Orange Birch Bolete** (Leccinum versipelle) - Orange-red cap, similar habitat
- **Other Leccinum species** - Various colors, all with scaly stems

### Brown Roll Rim
*Paxillus involutus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** Lethal
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland, especially birch

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (1000 ticks), Wither I (800 ticks)

**Identification:**
Brown Roll Rim is a dangerous mushroom that was once considered edible but is now known to be potentially lethal. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex with a strongly inrolled margin (hence "roll rim"), becoming flatter but usually retaining the inrolled edge throughout its life. The cap surface is sticky when wet, brown to olive-brown or rust-brown, with a matt, slightly felt-like texture. The gills are unusual - they are decurrent (running down the stem), yellowish-brown, crowded, and easily separable from the cap flesh (forked and interconnected). **Diagnostic feature:** The gills bruise dark brown to blackish when touched.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, slightly paler than the cap, solid, and often off-center. The flesh is pale yellowish-brown, soft, and bruises brown. There is no ring or volva. The mushroom has a mild smell and taste (though never taste this species). Brown Roll Rim is very common in mixed woodland, parks, and gardens, often forming mycorrhizal associations with birch and pine.

**EXTREME DANGER:** This mushroom contains a unique toxin that causes an autoimmune reaction. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Even if eaten without immediate ill effects, the toxin can cause the development of antibodies that attack red blood cells. Repeated consumption leads to accumulation of these antibodies, and a subsequent meal can trigger sudden and severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), potentially leading to kidney failure and death. There is no antidote. **Several deaths have been recorded, including experienced mycologists who ate this species repeatedly over years before succumbing.**

**Lookalikes:**
- Various brown gilled mushrooms, but the inrolled margin and darkly bruising, removable gills are distinctive

**WARNING:** NEVER eat this mushroom. Historically listed as edible with caution (after parboiling), but now known to be dangerous even when cooked. Avoid entirely.

### Cauliflower Fungus
*Sparassis crispa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** At base of pine trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Cauliflower Fungus is one of the most distinctive and unmistakable fungi in UK woodlands. The fruiting body is 10-40cm across (occasionally larger), forming a large, creamy-white to pale yellow mass of intricately branched, wavy lobes that truly resembles a cream-colored cauliflower or sea coral. The structure consists of numerous flattened, ribbon-like branches that are crisp and brittle when fresh. The entire fungus grows from a short, rooting stem base that is often buried in the soil or attached to roots.

This fungus grows exclusively at the base of pine trees (Pinus species) in the UK, though it can occur with other conifers elsewhere. It's a parasitic species that causes brown rot of the roots and heartwood, eventually killing the host tree. The same fruiting body can emerge from the same location year after year. The flesh is white to cream, crisp, and brittle when fresh, with a pleasant nutty smell.

Cauliflower Fungus is highly prized as an edible species. The young, fresh specimens have a mild, sweet, slightly nutty flavor and a pleasant crunchy texture. However, **cleaning is challenging** - the intricate folds trap pine needles, soil, and insects, requiring patient washing in multiple changes of water. The flavor is subtle, making it excellent in cream-based dishes, stir-fries, or simply sautéed in butter. It must be cooked thoroughly. Older specimens become tough and rubbery.

**Lookalikes:**
None - this is unmistakable. There is a similar species, S. spathulata, found with oak in southern England, which is equally edible.

### Cep / Penny Bun / Porcini
*Boletus edulis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Cep (also known as Penny Bun in the UK and Porcini in Italy) is one of the most highly prized edible mushrooms in the world. The cap is 7-30cm across (occasionally larger), bun-shaped in young specimens, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored various shades of brown - from pale tan to reddish-brown or dark brown. The margin often remains pale, creating a distinctive two-tone effect.

The pore surface is white when very young, becoming yellowish and then greenish-yellow with age. The pores do not bruise blue. The tubes are deeply depressed around the stem apex. **The stem is the key feature:** 8-25cm tall, 2-7cm thick, very robust and bulbous, colored pale brown to buff, and covered with a fine white network (reticulation) over the upper portion - this white net-like pattern is diagnostic.

The flesh is white, thick, firm in young specimens, not changing color when cut. It has a pleasant mild smell and a nutty taste. Ceps form mycorrhizal associations with various trees including oak, beech, birch, pine, and spruce. They often fruit in the same locations year after year, leading to closely guarded "secret spots" among foragers.

**Culinary Value:** Ceps are considered gourmet mushrooms with excellent firm texture and rich, earthy, nutty flavor. They can be eaten in numerous ways: sautéed, grilled, in risottos, pasta dishes, or soups. They dry exceptionally well and dried porcini are a staple of Italian cuisine, used to flavor stocks and sauces. Young, firm specimens are best - check for insect infestation as they're popular with wildlife too.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Bay Bolete** (Imleria badia) - Cap darker bay-brown, less robust, bruises blue-green
- **Bitter Bolete** (Tylopilus felleus) - BITTER. Pink pores, brown reticulation on stem
- **Devil's Bolete** (Rubroboletus satanas) - POISONOUS. Red pores, red on stem

**Warning:** Always check the pore color - white to yellow = good. Red pores = avoid.

### Chaga
*Inonotus obliquus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Medicinal Only
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Birch trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A (medicinal only)
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None (used in crafting)

**Identification:**
Chaga is one of the most unusual-looking fungi, forming large, irregular, black charcoal-like masses on the trunks of birch trees. The exterior is black, deeply cracked, and resembles burnt wood or charcoal, giving it the appearance of a tumor on the tree. The masses can be 25-40cm across and up to 50cm long. The interior is a rusty yellow-brown color with a corky or woody texture.

Unlike most bracket fungi, Chaga is not the fruiting body but a sterile conk - the actual fruiting occurs in a thin layer under the bark. Chaga is a parasitic fungus causing white rot in birch trees, eventually killing the host. It takes many years to develop substantial growth, typically appearing on trees that are at least 40 years old. The growth continues for 10-20+ years before the tree dies.

**Medicinal Properties:** Chaga has been used for centuries in Russian and Northern European folk medicine. Modern research has shown it contains numerous bioactive compounds:
- Extremely high in antioxidants (highest ORAC score of any natural food)
- Betulinic acid (from the birch tree)
- Polysaccharides with immune-modulating effects
- Anti-inflammatory compounds
- Potentially anti-cancer properties (ongoing research)

**Preparation:** Chaga is too woody to eat. It's typically harvested, dried, and made into tea by simmering chunks in hot water for several hours. The tea has a mild, slightly vanilla-like flavor. **Sustainable harvesting:** Only take from trees that are already dead or dying, leave at least 30% of the conk, and never strip it down to bare wood.

**WARNING:** Do not consume if taking blood-thinning medications or before surgery, as it has anticoagulant properties.

### Chanterelle
*Cantharellus cibarius*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Chanterelle is one of the most sought-after and distinctive edible mushrooms. The fruiting body is 2-10cm across, funnel-shaped or irregularly vase-shaped with a wavy, lobed margin. The entire mushroom is a beautiful egg-yolk yellow to golden-orange color. **Critical feature:** What appear to be gills are actually blunt, forked ridges or veins that run down the stem - these are not true gills. The ridges are thick, widely spaced, and forked repeatedly.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, solid, continuous with the cap, and colored like the cap or paler. The flesh is white to pale yellow, thick and firm, with a distinctive fruity aroma often compared to apricots. The taste is mildly peppery when raw (always cook - never eat raw). Chanterelles form mycorrhizal associations with various trees including oak, beech, birch, pine, and spruce. They often fruit in troops or fairy rings and return to the same locations year after year.

**Culinary Value:** Chanterelles are prized for their firm, meaty texture and fruity, peppery flavor. They hold up well to cooking and are excellent sautéed in butter with garlic, in cream sauces, with eggs, or added to pasta dishes and risottos. They should not be washed excessively as they absorb water readily - brush off dirt instead. Cook thoroughly. They freeze well but don't dry as successfully as some other mushrooms.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Chanterelle** (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) - INEDIBLE. True gills (not ridges), more orange, thinner flesh
- **Jack O'Lantern** (Omphalotus olearius) - POISONOUS. True gills, grows on wood, not found in UK

**Key Distinction:** Run your finger under the cap - true chanterelles have blunt, forked ridges that don't separate easily from the cap. False chanterelles have thin, separate gills.

### Charcoal Burner
*Russula cyanoxantha*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Charcoal Burner is considered one of the best edible Russula species in the UK. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flattened, often with a slight central depression. **The color is highly variable** - it can be purple, lilac, blue-grey, olive-green, or a mixture of these colors, often with different zones. This variability led to the species being confused for many different Russulas until microscopy confirmed they were all the same. The cap surface is smooth, slightly greasy when wet, with skin that peels halfway to the center.

The gills are the key identifying feature: they are white to cream, crowded, and **feel greasy or waxy to the touch** - this is unique among UK Russulas and is diagnostic. If you run your finger gently across the gills, they feel soft and flexible rather than brittle like other Russulas. The stem is 5-12cm tall, 1.5-3cm thick, white, solid, and firm. The flesh is white, firm, and **tastes mild** (not peppery) - this mild taste is critical for confirming edibility.

Charcoal Burner forms mycorrhizal associations with various deciduous trees, particularly oak and beech. The common name supposedly refers to the colors resembling iridescent charcoal. This is one of the safest Russulas to identify due to the combination of variable colors, greasy gills, and mild taste.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom with firm texture and good flavor. Can be cooked in any way - sautéed, grilled, or added to mixed mushroom dishes. The firm flesh holds up well to cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other Russulas - Check gills (greasy feel is unique) and taste (must be mild, not acrid)
- Purple/violet Russulas - Will have brittle gills and may have peppery taste

**Safety Check:** Always confirm mild taste (nibble and spit - do not swallow until certain) and greasy gill texture.

### Chicken of the Woods
*Laetiporus sulphureus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Spring to autumn (May-November)
- **Habitat:** Oak, yew, and other hardwoods

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Chicken of the Woods is one of the most visually striking and unmistakable fungi in the UK. It forms large, spectacular bracket-like shelves in overlapping tiers, each shelf 10-40cm across. The upper surface is bright sulphur-yellow to orange-yellow, smooth to slightly wrinkled, and has a suede-like texture. The underside has tiny sulphur-yellow pores (3-4 per mm). Young fresh specimens are soft, moist, and have a texture remarkably similar to chicken breast when cooked - hence the common name.

The brackets grow directly from tree trunks or from buried roots with no stem. The flesh is thick, white to pale yellow, and soft when young, becoming tough and chalky with age. Only young, fresh, brightly colored specimens are edible - older specimens become tough and can cause gastric upset. This fungus causes brown cubical rot in hardwood trees, particularly oak, yew, willow, and sweet chestnut.

**Culinary Value:** When young and tender, this mushroom tastes remarkably like chicken, making it popular with vegetarians as a meat substitute. The texture is stringy and similar to chicken breast. It can be sliced and sautéed, breaded and fried like chicken schnitzel, or added to stir-fries and curries. **CAUTION:** A small percentage of people experience gastric upset from this species, even when properly cooked. Try a small amount first. Never harvest from yew trees as the fungus can absorb yew toxins.

**Lookalikes:**
None - this combination of bright colors, bracket form, and pore surface is unmistakable. There is a similar species (L. cincinnatus) that grows at the base of oaks, which is equally edible.

**WARNING:** Only eat young, soft specimens. Avoid if growing on yew, laburnum, or other toxic trees. Some people are sensitive - try small amounts first.

### Cinnabar Bracket
*Pycnoporus cinnabarinus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead hardwood

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Cinnabar Bracket is a small to medium-sized bracket fungus that is instantly recognizable by its brilliant orange-red to cinnabar-red color. The brackets are 3-10cm across, roughly semicircular or kidney-shaped, thin and leathery, growing singly or in overlapping tiers. The upper surface is smooth to slightly zoned, colored bright orange-red when fresh and young, fading to dull orange-brown with age and exposure to sunlight. The entire fungus, including the pore surface, is the same bright color.

The pore surface has very small pores (4-5 per mm), creating an almost smooth appearance. There is no stem - the bracket attaches laterally to the wood. The flesh is thin (1-3mm), tough, and corky, colored similarly throughout. This fungus is a white rot species growing on dead branches and logs of hardwood trees, particularly beech, but also oak, ash, and sycamore. It persists year-round but is most noticeable in winter when the vibrant color stands out.

The brilliant color comes from the pigment cinnabarin, which has antifungal and antibacterial properties. While not toxic, the fungus is far too tough and woody to be edible. In traditional medicine, related species have been used for various purposes, but there is limited research on this specific species. It plays an important ecological role in deadwood decomposition.

**Lookalikes:**
None in the UK - no other bracket is this consistently bright orange-red throughout.

### Clouded Funnel
*Clitocybe nebularis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but causes reactions in some people)
- **Season:** Autumn (September-December)
- **Habitat:** Woodland edges and clearings

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Clouded Funnel is a large, robust mushroom that grows in impressive troops or fairy rings in woodland, particularly around the edges of clearings. The cap is 8-20cm across (occasionally larger), convex when young, soon becoming flat and then shallowly funnel-shaped with a wavy margin. The color is grey-brown, grey, or buff-grey - the common name "clouded" refers to this cloudy grey appearance and the somewhat zoned, cloud-like surface. The surface is smooth, matt, and dry.

The gills are crowded, decurrent (running down the stem), white to cream, and sometimes develop yellow-brown spots with age. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 2-3cm thick, robust, swollen at the base, and colored like the cap. The flesh is thick, white, and firm with a **very strong, distinctive smell** that is sweet, fruity, and somewhat sickly or perfumed - some describe it as similar to tomcat urine or artificial fruit flavoring. This strong smell is diagnostic.

**Edibility Concerns:** Clouded Funnel is listed as edible in older books but causes gastric upset in a significant number of people, even when properly cooked. Some individuals can eat it with no problems, while others experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The reaction may be allergic or due to individual sensitivity. For this reason, it's considered "edible with caution" and is best avoided. If trying it, eat only a small amount when first testing.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Ivory Funnel** (Clitocybe dealbata) - DEADLY. Much smaller, white, no strong smell, in grassland
- **Fool's Funnel** (C. rivulosa) - DEADLY. Smaller, whiter, grassland species
- Other large Clitocybe species - Generally distinguish by smell and habitat

**WARNING:** Due to individual sensitivity and risk of confusion with deadly grassland Clitocybe species, this mushroom is best avoided.

### Clustered Bonnet
*Mycena inclinata*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Oak stumps and logs

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Clustered Bonnet is a small mushroom that forms dense, tightly packed clusters on oak stumps and logs. Each individual cap is 1-4cm across, bell-shaped to conical, colored pale brown to grey-brown with a slightly darker, striated margin when moist. The cap surface is smooth and hygrophanous (changes color with moisture). The gills are white to pale cream, adnexed (just attached to the stem), and develop reddish-brown spots with age - this spotting is a diagnostic feature.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, very thin (1-3mm), hollow, fragile, and colored pale at the top, darker brown toward the base. The stems are often curved or "inclined" (hence the species name inclinata), especially those growing on the sides of logs. The flesh is thin, fragile, and has a distinctive smell like rancid fat or meal. Taste is bitter.

This species is specific to oak (Quercus), growing on dead stumps, logs, and buried wood. It plays an ecological role in wood decomposition but is far too small, tough, and bitter to be considered for eating. The dense clustering habit, oak specificity, and red-spotted gills help distinguish it from other small Mycena species.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other Mycena species - Most don't grow in such dense clusters on oak
- **Oak-stump Bonnet** (Mycena inclinata) - Nearly identical (may be same species)

**Additional Images:** [First Nature - Clustered Bonnet](https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/mycena-inclinata.php)

### Common Earthball
*Scleroderma citrinum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland and heathland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison I (400 ticks), Confusion I (300 ticks)

**Identification:**
Common Earthball is a dangerous mushroom that is sometimes mistaken for edible puffballs, leading to poisonings. The fruiting body is 3-10cm across, roughly spherical to irregular in shape, sitting on or partially buried in the ground. **Critical difference from puffballs:** The outer skin (peridium) is thick (2-5mm), hard, and leathery, colored yellowish-brown to ochre, and covered with small warts or scales that form a mosaic-like pattern.

The base is attached to the ground by thick white mycelial cords. When cut open, the interior is initially white, quickly becoming purple-black to black and firm. This black interior is solid and marbled (not powdery), divided into compartments - **puffballs are white and fluffy inside when edible, never purple-black and solid**. When fully mature, the earthball cracks irregularly at the top to release spores. The smell is unpleasant, earthy, and pungent.

**TOXICITY:** Common Earthball contains toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress including violent vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea within 1-3 hours of eating. While rarely life-threatening, the symptoms are very unpleasant and can require medical treatment. The toxins are not destroyed by cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Giant Puffball** (Calvatia gigantea) - EDIBLE. Much larger, pure white inside, thin skin, no scales
- **Common Puffball** (Lycoperdon perlatum) - EDIBLE when white inside. Pear-shaped, thin skin, spiny then smooth
- **Stump Puffball** (Lycoperdon pyriforme) - EDIBLE when white inside. Grows on wood, thin skin

**Safety Rule:** NEVER eat any puffball-like fungus unless you have cut it in half and confirmed:
1. Pure white inside (no hint of purple, pink, yellow, or black)
2. Uniform texture throughout (no developing gills or distinct internal structure)
3. Thin, papery skin (not thick and leathery)

### Common Morel
*Morchella esculenta*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible (must be cooked!)
- **Toxicity:** Toxic when raw
- **Season:** Spring (March-May)
- **Habitat:** Woodland edges, disturbed ground

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 6
- **Saturation:** 0.8
- **Effects:** None (when cooked)

**Identification:**
Common Morel is one of the most prized and distinctive spring mushrooms. The fruiting body is 5-12cm tall, consisting of a distinctive honeycomb-like cap atop a stout hollow stem. The cap is 3-8cm tall and roughly oval to conical, completely covered with deep pits and ridges forming an irregular honeycomb or brain-like pattern. The ridges are paler buff to cream, while the pits are darker greyish-brown to yellowish-brown.

**Critical features:** The cap is **completely hollow** throughout, as is the stem - when cut vertically, the entire interior is one continuous hollow chamber. The cap margin is attached directly to the stem with no gap. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 2-3cm thick, white to cream, hollow, and often slightly grooved or textured. The flesh is thin, brittle, and has a pleasant fruity smell.

Morels appear in spring (March-May in UK) in various habitats: woodland edges, parks, gardens, old orchards, and disturbed ground. They particularly favor lime-rich soils and ash trees. They're notorious for appearing abundantly one year and then being absent for several years. Some foragers have success finding them where wood chip mulch has been spread. They form mycorrhizal associations with various trees.

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** Morels are **TOXIC when raw** and must be thoroughly cooked before eating. Raw morels contain hydrazine toxins that are destroyed by cooking. Symptoms of raw morel poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Some people also react to cooked morels, especially if eaten with alcohol - try small amounts first. Never eat morels with alcohol.

**Culinary Value:** When properly cooked, morels are gourmet mushrooms with a distinctive earthy, nutty, meaty flavor. They're excellent stuffed, sautéed in butter, in cream sauces, or with eggs. The hollow structure requires thorough washing to remove insects and soil. They dry exceptionally well.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Morel** (Gyromitra esculenta) - DEADLY. Brain-like, not honeycomb, cap not attached to stem, not hollow throughout
- True morels can be distinguished by the honeycomb pattern and completely hollow interior

**WARNING:** NEVER eat morels raw. NEVER eat false morels. Always cook thoroughly.

### Common Puffball
*Lycoperdon perlatum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible (only when pure white inside)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, grassland, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Common Puffball is one of the most widespread and easily recognized puffball species. The fruiting body is 3-6cm tall and 2-4cm wide, pear-shaped or top-shaped with a rounded head and narrower stem-like base. When young and fresh, the outer surface is white to cream and covered with small conical spines or warts arranged in a distinctive pattern. As the mushroom matures, these spines fall away, leaving a network of scars and a smoother surface that becomes buff to brown.

**Critical edibility check:** Cut the puffball in half from top to bottom. It is ONLY edible when the interior is pure white, firm, and homogeneous throughout like marshmallow. If there is any yellowing, browning, purple tinge, or development of internal structure (gills, distinct chambers), it is past edible stage. The base tapers to a short sterile stem that is spongy and inedible.

When mature, the top develops a small hole (ostiole) through which olive-brown spores puff out like smoke when the fruiting body is compressed - hence "puffball." The Common Puffball grows in woodland, parks, and grassland, often in troops or fairy rings. It has a mild, mushroomy smell.

**Culinary Value:** When young and pure white inside, puffballs have a mild, pleasant taste and firm texture. They can be sliced and fried in butter, added to soups, or breaded and fried. Remove the tough outer skin before cooking. The mild flavor makes them versatile. They don't store well and should be used fresh.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Thick leathery skin, purple-black inside, warty surface
- **Stump Puffball** (Lycoperdon pyriforme) - Edible. Similar but grows on wood, clustered
- **Giant Puffball** (Calvatia gigantea) - Edible. Much larger

**Safety Rule:** ONLY eat when cut open reveals pure white interior with no structures or discoloration.

###Cramp Balls / King Alfred's Cakes
*Daldinia concentrica*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead ash wood

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Cramp Balls is a distinctive fungus forming hard, black, hemispherical or ball-like structures on dead ash branches and logs. Each ball is 2-8cm across, initially reddish-brown when developing under the bark, emerging as shiny black to dark brown hemispherical lumps. The surface is hard and brittle, minutely warty or pimpled with the tiny ostioles (pore openings) of the perithecia. When mature, the surface is dull black.

The most distinctive feature is revealed when the fungus is cut or broken in half - the interior shows concentric zones of silver-grey and black in alternating rings, like tree rings. These zones represent yearly growth layers. This concentrically zoned interior is diagnostic. The entire structure is rock-hard and woody. Each "ball" can persist for several years, growing larger each season.

This fungus is almost exclusively found on dead ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) in the UK, though it can rarely occur on other hardwoods. It's a pyrenomycete, producing spores in flask-shaped chambers embedded in the stroma. The common name "King Alfred's Cakes" comes from the legend of King Alfred burning cakes - the blackened appearance resembles burnt cakes. "Cramp Balls" refers to historical folk use - people carried them in pockets to ward off cramps and rheumatism.

While not toxic, Cramp Balls are completely inedible due to their rock-hard, woody texture. Historically, the dried balls were used as tinder for starting fires and would smolder for a long time. They're an excellent indicator of ash trees and play a role in deadwood ecology.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Beech Woodwart** (Hypoxylon fragiforme) - Smaller, reddish-brown, on beech
- **Coal Fungus** (Hypoxylon) species - Similar but smaller, different colors

### Death Cap
*Amanita phalloides*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous woodland, especially oak and beech

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither II (600 ticks), Poison III (1200 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Death Cap is responsible for more fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide than any other species. Half a cap can kill an adult. There is no antidote.**

The Death Cap is a medium to large Amanita. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially hemispher ical with the margin tucked under, expanding to convex and finally flat. The color varies from **pale greenish-yellow to olive-green to yellowish-brown**, sometimes almost white. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, and may have faint radial fibrils. Patches of veil remnants may be present but often wash off. The cap margin is not striated.

The gills are white, crowded, and free from the stem. **They remain white - never pink, brown, or rusty.** This is critical. The stem is 7-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slightly tapering upward, often with a faint snakeskin (zigzag) pattern. It has a large, pendulous, skirt-like ring (annulus) that is white with faint striations on the upper surface. **The base has a large, sac-like volva** (cup) that is often buried in soil - you must dig around the base to see it.

The flesh is white and has a mild smell when young, developing a sickly-sweet smell like honey or flowers as it ages. The taste is reportedly mild (NEVER TASTE THIS MUSHROOM).

**TOXICITY:** Death Cap contains amatoxins - these are cyclic peptides that inhibit RNA polymerase II, preventing protein synthesis and causing cell death, particularly in liver and kidney cells. **Symptoms appear 6-24 hours after eating** - by which time the toxins have been absorbed and damage is underway:
- Phase 1: Severe vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: Apparent recovery (1-2 days) - toxins still causing liver damage
- Phase 3: Liver and kidney failure (3-5 days), often fatal without liver transplant

**Even with immediate medical treatment, mortality rate is 10-20%. Cooking does NOT destroy the toxins.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - Gills turn pink then brown, no volva, pleasant smell
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - Gills turn greyish then brown, smells of aniseed, no volva
- Edible Amanitas (Blusher, Grisette) - Different colors, different volva structure, edibility questionable

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
1. **NEVER eat a mushroom with the combination: white gills + ring + volva**
2. **ALWAYS dig around the base to check for a volva**
3. **When in doubt, throw it out**
4. **Avoid all Amanitas unless you are an expert**
5. **If you suspect you've eaten Death Cap, GO TO HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY - don't wait for symptoms**

### Deadly Dapperling
*Lepiota brunneoincarnata*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, parks, gardens

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither II (600 ticks), Poison III (1000 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Dapperling contains the same lethal amatoxins as Death Cap and is responsible for numerous fatal poisonings in Europe.**

Deadly Dapperling is a small to medium-sized mushroom. The cap is 2-7cm across, initially conical, expanding to nearly flat with a low broad umbo. The cap surface is covered with small pinkish-brown to reddish-brown scales concentrated toward the center, with a paler background. The center is darker brown. The gills are white to cream, free from the stem, and crowded.

The stem is 3-7cm tall, 0.5-1cm thick, cylindrical, white above and covered with similar pinkish-brown scales below, especially toward the base. There is a small ring that may be ephemeral and disappear with age. The flesh is white with a faint fruity or unpleasant smell.

This species grows in grassy areas, parks, gardens, and woodland edges. It's often found in association with other small Lepiota species. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms and has caused fatal poisonings.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains amatoxins - the same liver and kidney-destroying toxins found in Death Cap. Despite its small size, it is potentially fatal. Symptoms are delayed (6-24 hours), and by the time they appear, serious organ damage has occurred. Treatment has limited success - liver transplant may be required. **THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE. Much larger, ring movable, no pink tones
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. Much larger (10-25cm cap), tall with snakeskin stem
- Other small Lepiota species - Many are toxic or of unknown edibility

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **NEVER eat small ( mushrooms (cap under 10cm) with free gills and a ring.** Many small Lepiotas are toxic or deadly, and distinguishing species requires microscopy. The risk far outweighs any culinary benefit.

### Deadly Fibrecap
*Inocybe erubescens*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Spring to summer (May-August)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous woodland, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (800 ticks), Confusion I (600 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Fibrecap contains the highest levels of muscarine of any mushroom - up to 20 times more than Fly Agaric. It has caused fatalities.**

Deadly Fibrecap is a medium-sized Inocybe species. The cap is 3-9cm across, initially conical with a prominent central umbo, expanding but retaining the umbo. The cap surface is radially fibrous (hence "fibrecap"), colored white to cream when young, developing pink to reddish-pink tones, especially toward the margin when bruised or with age. The center remains paler. The gills are initially white, becoming grey-brown, adnexed to almost free, crowded.

The stem is 4-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical or slightly swollen at base, white, solid, often bruising pinkish-red like the cap. The flesh is white, thick, turning pink-red slowly when cut or damaged. This pinkish-red bruising is diagnostic but **does not appear immediately**. The smell is described as fruity or spermatic (similar to Hawthorn blossom). The taste is said to be mild to slightly bitter (NEVER TASTE).

This species fruits in late spring to early summer under deciduous trees, particularly in parks and along woodland paths. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms including St George's Mushroom, leading to serious poisonings.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains extremely high concentrations of muscarine, which causes "muscarinic syndrome":
- Symptoms appear within 15-30 minutes (unlike amatoxin poisoning)
- SLUDGE syndrome: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastrointestinal distress, Emesis
- Excessive sweating, tearing, drooling
- Bradycardia (slow heart rate), bronchial constriction, respiratory distress
- Can be fatal without treatment (atropine antidote available)
- Death can occur from respiratory failure

**Lookalikes:**
- **St George's Mushroom** (Calocybe gambosa) - EDIBLE. No red staining, mealy smell, different season/habitat
- Other Inocybe species - Many are toxic to varying degrees; none should be eaten

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **AVOID all Inocybe species entirely.** They are difficult to distinguish, and many are poisonous. The genus has a poor risk-benefit ratio for foragers.

### Deadly Parasol
*Chlorophyllum molybdites*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS (Not native to UK)
- **Toxicity:** Moderate to Severe
- **Season:** Summer to autumn
- **Habitat:** Grassland, gardens (rare in UK)

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither II (600 ticks), Poison III (1000 ticks)

**Identification:**
**NOTE: This species is not native to the UK but is included due to its importance in mushroom poisonings worldwide and potential introduction via imported materials.**

Deadly Parasol (also called Green-spored Parasol or False Parasol) closely resembles edible Parasol mushrooms. The cap is 10-30cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to flat with a low umbo. The surface is white to cream covered with brown to pinkish-brown scales that are denser at the center. The gills start white but turn **greenish-grey to grey-green as spores mature** - this green color is diagnostic and differentiates it from true Parasols.

The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical with a bulbous base, white to pale brown below. It has a large, movable, double-edged ring. The flesh is white but may discolor slightly when cut. The spore print is distinctive **green to grey-green**.

**TOXICITY:** This species is responsible for the most mushroom poisonings in North America. It contains toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress:
- Symptoms appear 1-3 hours after eating
- Severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea
- Symptoms can be extremely severe and may require hospitalization
- Usually resolves in 24-48 hours but can be dangerous for elderly, young, or those with health conditions
- NOT fatal in most cases but highly unpleasant

**Lookalikes:**
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. White to cream spores, not green, different ring structure
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE with caution. No green gills, bruises orange-red

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** **Always check the gills of large parasol-like mushrooms**. If they have any hint of green or grey-green, AVOID. Always take a spore print to confirm - edible parasols have white to cream spores, never green.

### Deadly Webcap
*Cortinarius rubellus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither I (1200 ticks), Poison II (1200 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Webcap contains orellanine, a toxin that causes irreversible kidney failure. The delayed onset of symptoms (2-21 days) means victims often don't connect illness to mushroom consumption until severe damage is done. Multiple fatalities recorded.**

Deadly Webcap is a medium-sized Cortinarius species. The cap is 3-8cm across, conical to bell-shaped, expanding to convex with a distinct umbo. The surface is finely fibrous to scaly, colored orange-brown to cinnamon-brown or reddish-brown. The gills are initially cinnamon-orange, becoming more rust-brown with age, adnate to slightly decurrent.

The stem is 5-12cm tall, 0.5-1.5cm thick, cylindrical, colored orange-brown to yellow-brown with darker reddish-brown fibrous bands or girdles (zones). When young, there is a cobweb-like cortina (veil) connecting cap margin to stem - this leaves rusty remnants on the stem. The flesh is yellowish to orange-brown with no distinctive smell.

This species grows in coniferous woodland, particularly with pine and spruce, in upland areas. It's found in Scotland and northern England. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms, including chanterelles by inexperienced foragers, with fatal consequences.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains orellanine, a bipyridine compound that causes **delayed and progressive kidney failure**:
- **Latency period:** 2-21 days (commonly 3-14 days) before symptoms appear
- Initial symptoms: Intense thirst, dry mouth, headache, fatigue
- Progresses to kidney pain, decreased urination
- Leads to acute kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant
- **NO ANTIDOTE** - treatment is supportive only
- Mortality rate is significant; survivors often require lifelong dialysis

The long delay means victims may not associate symptoms with mushroom consumption, delaying treatment. Even small amounts can cause irreversible damage.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fool's Webcap** (Cortinarius orellanus) - EQUALLY DEADLY, similar toxins, more orange
- **Chanterelle** (Cantharellus cibarius) - EDIBLE but completely different structure: false gills (ridges), funnel-shaped
- Other Cortinarius species - Many are unknown or potentially toxic

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **NEVER eat any Cortinarius species.** The genus contains several deadly species and many of unknown toxicity. They are difficult to distinguish even for experts. The severe, delayed, and irreversible consequences make the risk unacceptable.

### Deceiver
*Laccaria laccata*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-December)
- **Habitat:** Woodland and heathland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Deceiver earns its name from its highly variable appearance depending on moisture conditions - it "deceives" by looking like many different mushrooms at different times. The cap is 2-6cm across, convex to flat, often with a depressed center and wavy margin. **The color is highly hygrophanous**: when moist, it's orange-brown, pinkish-brown to reddish-brown; when dry, it fades to pale buff, cream, or pinkish-white. This dramatic color change is characteristic.

The gills are thick, widely spaced, broadly attached to slightly decurrent, colored similarly to the cap. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 3-8mm thick, tough and fibrous, colored like the cap, often longitudinally fibrous and twisted. The base is covered with white mycelial threads. The flesh is thin, colored like the cap, with no distinctive smell or taste.

Deceiver is extremely common and widespread, forming mycorrhizal associations with various trees in deciduous and coniferous woodland, heathland, and parks. It can appear in large troops. **The combination of variable color, widely spaced thick gills, tough fibrous stem, and white basal mycelium helps identification.**

**Edibility:** While edible, the Deceiver is not highly rated due to its thin flesh and tough, fibrous texture. Some people enjoy the mild, slightly nutty flavor. It can be fried or added to soups and stews. Must be cooked thoroughly. The stem is too tough and should be discarded. Not worth seeking out, but can be used if found in quantity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Amethyst Deceiver** (Laccaria amethystina) - Purple when fresh, otherwise similar
- Various small brown mushrooms - Check for thick, widely spaced gills and fibrous stem

### Destroying Angel
*Amanita virosa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither II (600 ticks), Poison III (1200 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Destroying Angel is one of the deadliest mushrooms in the world, containing the same amatoxins as Death Cap. Half a mushroom can kill an adult. There is no antidote. The pure white appearance can make it look innocuous and has led to fatal poisonings.**

Destroying Angel is a medium to large, pure white Amanita. The cap is 5-12cm across, initially conical to bell-shaped, expanding to convex and sometimes flat. The entire mushroom is **pure white or very slightly cream**, giving it an innocent appearance that belies its deadly nature. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, sometimes with a few white patches of veil remnants. The margin is not striated.

The gills are white, free from the stem, crowded. The stem is 7-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical or slightly tapering upward, often with a slightly shaggy or scaly surface. It has a large, skirt-like ring that is white and pendant. **The base is buried in a large, sac-like volva (cup)** that is white and often completely hidden in soil - you must dig to see it.

The flesh is white and has a distinctive sweet, sickly smell, sometimes described as like honey or roses. This smell becomes more pronounced as the mushroom ages. Young specimens may have little smell. Taste is reportedly mild (NEVER TASTE THIS MUSHROOM).

**TOXICITY:** Contains amatoxins (alpha-amanitin and related compounds) at similar or higher concentrations than Death Cap:
- **Symptoms delayed 6-24 hours** (by which time toxins have been absorbed)
- Phase 1: Severe vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, dehydration (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: False recovery period (1-2 days) - liver damage continuing
- Phase 3: Liver and kidney failure (3-7 days), jaundice, internal bleeding, often fatal
- **Mortality rate 50% even with treatment**
- Liver transplant may be required
- **Cooking does NOT destroy toxins**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - Gills turn pink then chocolate brown, no volva
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - Gills turn brown, pleasant anise smell, no volva
- **Wood Mushroom** (Agaricus sylvicola) - Gills turn brown, in woodland, no volva

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** Any white mushroom with:
- White gills that stay white
- A ring on the stem
- A volva at the base
= **DEADLY AMANITA - AVOID ENTIRELY**

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
1. **NEVER eat a completely white mushroom with white gills, ring, and volva**
2. **ALWAYS dig around the base to check for volva**
3. **The combination of white gills + ring + volva = DEATH**
4. **When in doubt, throw it out**
5. **If you suspect you've eaten Destroying Angel, go to hospital IMMEDIATELY**

### Devil's Bolete
*Rubroboletus satanas*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate to Severe
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-October)
- **Habitat:** Calcareous woodland (beech, oak)

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (600 ticks), Confusion I (800 ticks)

**Identification:**
Devil's Bolete is a large, robust, and unmistakable bolete. The cap is 8-30cm across, hemispherical becoming convex, colored pale whitish-grey to dirty grey or yellowish-grey - never brown like edible boletes. The pore surface is **blood-red to orange-red** when young (diagnostic), fading to orange or yellow-orange with age. The pores bruise blue immediately when touched.

The stem is 5-15cm tall, 3-8cm thick, very stout and bulbous, colored yellow in the upper part, flushed or entirely covered with blood-red to orange-red coloration, especially in the middle and lower portions. This red-flushed stem is diagnostic. There is often a reddish network pattern on the stem. The flesh is pale yellow, turning very slightly blue when cut, with an unpleasant smell when mature (rancid or like carrion).

Devil's Bolete grows in warm, calcareous (chalky/limestone) areas under beech and oak in southern England. It's rare but distinctive. The combination of pale grey cap, red pores, and red-marked stem makes it unmistakable.

**TOXICITY:** Contains unknown toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress within 1-2 hours: violent vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Symptoms are serious but usually resolve within 24-48 hours. Not fatal in recorded cases but extremely unpleasant. Toxins are not destroyed by cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the red pores and stem immediately distinguish it from all edible boletes.

**Safety Rule:** **NEVER eat any bolete with red or orange pores.** While not all are severely toxic, none are worth risking.

### Field Mushroom
*Agaricus campestris*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, pastures, lawns

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Field Mushroom is the wild relative of the cultivated button mushroom and one of the best-known edible species. The cap is 3-10cm across, initially hemispherical with margin tucked under, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap is white to cream, sometimes with fine brownish scales toward the center, smooth and dry. Young specimens have a silky sheen.

**Critical identifying features:** The gills are free from the stem and show a distinctive color progression: **pink when young (button stage), becoming pink-brown, and finally dark chocolate-brown to blackish-brown when mature as spores are released.** This gill color change is diagnostic for edible Agaricus species and immediately distinguishes them from deadly white Amanitas (which have white gills throughout).

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, smooth, cylindrical, with a simple white ring that is often thin and may disappear with age. The stem base is not bulbous and there is **no volva (cup)** - this absence of volva immediately excludes deadly Amanitas. The flesh is white, sometimes faintly pink when cut, with a pleasant mushroom smell.

Field Mushrooms grow in unimproved grassland, pastures, lawns, and meadows, especially where horses or cattle graze. They often appear in rings or troops after rain in late summer and autumn. They have a saprobic ecology, feeding on organic matter in the soil.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom with a classic mushroom flavor - rich, earthy, and savory. Can be used in any dish: fried, grilled, in soups, sauces, on pizza, with eggs. Young specimens ("buttons") are best eaten raw in salads, while larger ones are better cooked. The dark gills can color dishes black, which is harmless but may be unattractive.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Stains bright yellow at stem base when pressed, chemical/ink smell
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills that stay white, volva, sweet smell
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. White gills, greenish cap often, volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. **Check gill color:** Must be pink to brown, NEVER pure white
2. **Check stem base:** No volva (cup), no bulb - stem base is level with ground
3. **Check for yellowing:** Press stem base - if it turns bright chrome yellow, it's poisonous Yellow Stainer
4. **Smell:** Pleasant mushroomy smell, not chemical or sickly-sweet

### Fly Agaric
*Amanita muscaria*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate to Severe
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Birch and pine woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (600 ticks), Confusion II (800 ticks), Slowness II (400 ticks)

**Identification:**
Fly Agaric is one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable mushrooms in the world. The cap is 8-20cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap surface is a brilliant scarlet-red to orange-red, covered with white to yellowish-white warts or patches (remnants of the universal veil). These warts can wash off in heavy rain. The cap margin is often striated.

The gills are white to cream, free from the stem, and crowded. The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-3cm thick, white, slightly bulbous at the base with concentric rings or bands above the bulb rather than a distinct volva sac. There is a large, white, skirt-like ring on the upper stem that is often torn or shaggy. The flesh is white, yellowish just under the cap skin, with a faint smell.

**TOXICITY:** Contains ibotenic acid and muscimol (not muscarine despite the name). These are psychoactive compounds causing:
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Drowsiness, dizziness, lack of coordination
- Confusion, hallucinations, delirium
- Muscle twitching, jerking movements
- Usually not fatal but can be dangerous, especially for children
- Effects last 4-10 hours

**Cultural Note:** Historically used as intoxicant in Siberian shamanic rituals. Despite its iconic status and some historical use, it should be avoided due to unpredictable effects and toxicity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Caesar's Mushroom** (Amanita caesarea) - EDIBLE but not found in UK, orange cap, yellow gills
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - Edible when cooked, brownish cap with pinkish warts, flushes red

**WARNING:** Never eat Fly Agaric. While rarely fatal, the effects are unpredictable and unpleasant.

### Fool's Funnel
*Clitocybe rivulosa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, lawns, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison III (800 ticks), Confusion II (600 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Fool's Funnel is deadly poisonous, containing high levels of muscarine. It has caused fatalities and is particularly dangerous because it grows in lawns where people may not expect deadly mushrooms.**

Fool's Funnel is a small to medium-sized white mushroom. The cap is 2-8cm across, initially convex, becoming flat and then funnel-shaped with age. The cap surface is white to cream or pale buff, smooth, sometimes with a frosted or powdery appearance. The margin is initially inrolled, becoming wavy. The cap can develop brownish spots with age.

The gills are white to cream, crowded, decurrent (running down the stem). The stem is 2-5cm tall, 0.5-1cm thick, white, equal or slightly swollen at base, fibrous. The flesh is white, thin, with a faint mealy or cucumber-like smell. There is no ring or volva.

Fool's Funnel grows in short grass in lawns, parks, playing fields, and grassland, often forming rings or lines. It frequently fruits alongside edible mushrooms like Field Mushrooms, making it particularly dangerous.

**TOXICITY:** Contains very high levels of muscarine:
- Symptoms appear within 15-30 minutes
- Excessive salivation, sweating, tearing
- Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Blurred vision, constricted pupils
- Slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing
- Can be fatal without treatment (atropine antidote available)

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fairy Ring Champignon** (Marasmius oreades) - EDIBLE. Tough stem, widely spaced gills, sweet smell
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - EDIBLE. Gills turn pink then brown
- **Miller** (Clitopilus prunulus) - EDIBLE. Mealy smell, gills turn pink, spore print pink

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** NEVER eat small white mushrooms from lawns and grassland unless you are absolutely certain of identification. The risk is too great.

### Giant Puffball
*Calvatia gigantea*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible (only when pure white inside)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, meadows, woodland edges

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Giant Puffball is one of the most impressive and unmistakable edible fungi. The fruiting body is truly giant: 10-80cm across (occasionally over 1 meter), roughly spherical to slightly flattened, white when young. There is no stem - the puffball sits directly on the ground or has minimal basal attachment. The outer surface is smooth, white, sometimes developing a very fine texture like chamois leather.

**Critical edibility check:** Cut the puffball in half from top to bottom. It is ONLY edible when:
1. The interior is pure white throughout - like firm marshmallow or tofu
2. There is NO hint of yellow, brown, purple, or any internal structure
3. The texture is firm and homogeneous

Once the interior begins to turn yellow or develops spores, it is past edible stage and will cause gastric upset. When fully mature, the interior becomes a mass of olive-brown spores like dust.

Giant Puffballs grow in nutrient-rich grassland, meadows, pastures, parks, and woodland edges. They often appear in the same location year after year. A single specimen can provide several pounds of edible mushroom.

**Culinary Value:** When young and white inside, Giant Puffball is excellent eating. The flavor is mild and slightly nutty. The texture is firm and meaty. It can be:
- Sliced into "steaks" and fried in butter
- Breaded and fried like schnitzel
- Cut into cubes for soups and stews
- Added to stir-fries
- Used as a pizza base (slice horizontally)

Remove the tough outer skin before cooking. The mild flavor makes it versatile and it absorbs other flavors well.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Much smaller, thick leathery skin, purple-black inside, warty
- **Immature Amanitas (egg stage)** - POTENTIALLY DEADLY. Much smaller, when cut shows outline of developing mushroom inside, not homogeneous

**Safety Rule:** ALWAYS cut open any puffball before eating. Only eat when pure white inside with no structures visible.

### Grey Spotted Amanita
*Amanita spissa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None (but easily confused with toxic species)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and coniferous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Grey Spotted Amanita is a robust Amanita that is not toxic but easily confused with poisonous species. The cap is 5-12cm across, convex to flat, grey-brown to dark brown, covered with irregular grey to grey-brown warts or patches. The gills are white, free, crowded. The stem is 7-15cm tall, stout, white to grey, with grey-brown staining especially toward base. There is a white ring and a bulbous base with irregular ridges rather than a distinct volva.

The flesh is white, staining grey, with no distinctive smell. This species bruises and stains grey rather than red (unlike the edible Blusher).

**WARNING:** While not poisonous, this mushroom is best avoided due to easy confusion with the toxic Panther Cap and other dangerous Amanitas. Not recommended for consumption.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Panther Cap** (Amanita pantherina) - DEADLY. Pure white ring, marginate volva, does not stain
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - Edible when cooked. Stains red not grey

**Additional Images:** [First Nature - Grey Spotted Amanita](https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/amanita-spissa.php)

### Grisette
*Amanita vaginata*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but must never be eaten raw)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-October)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Grisette is a medium-sized Amanita that lacks a ring on the stem - this immediately distinguishes it from most dangerous Amanitas. The cap is 4-10cm across, initially bell-shaped, expanding to flat, with a distinctive deeply striated or grooved margin (extending up to halfway to center). The cap is grey to grey-brown, sometimes paler, smooth with occasional white patches of veil remnants.

The gills are white, free, crowded. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slender, fragile, hollow, with no ring. The base sits in a loose, white, sac-like volva. The flesh is white, thin, fragile, with no distinctive smell.

**Safety Note:** While edible when thoroughly cooked, Grisette is easily confused with deadly Amanitas by beginners. The lack of a ring is distinctive, but this requires careful observation. **Must be cooked - never eat raw.** Due to confusion potential and mediocre culinary value, best avoided unless expert.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, greenish cap
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, pure white
- **Tawny Grisette** (Amanita fulva) - Edible. Orange-brown cap, otherwise similar

### Hedgehog Mushroom
*Hydnum repandum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and coniferous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Hedgehog Mushroom is an excellent edible species with a distinctive feature that makes it virtually impossible to confuse with anything toxic - it has spines instead of gills or pores. The cap is 4-12cm across, irregular in shape, convex to flat with a wavy, lobed margin. The surface is smooth, dry, colored pale cream to pale orange or peachy-buff.

**Diagnostic feature:** The underside is covered with soft, brittle spines (teeth) 3-6mm long that are cream to pale buff colored and easily detach from the cap. These spines run slightly down the stem. No toxic mushrooms have this spine structure, making Hedgehog a safe beginner's mushroom.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-3cm thick, off-center or central, white to pale cream, solid. The flesh is thick, white, firm, brittle, with a pleasant mild smell and taste. Hedgehog Mushroom forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees in deciduous and coniferous woodland, often growing in troops.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom with a firm texture and slightly nutty, peppery flavor. The spines should be gently scraped off before cooking as they can be slightly bitter. Excellent sautéed in butter, in cream sauces, soups, or with eggs. The firm flesh holds up well to cooking. Can be dried successfully.

**Lookalikes:**
None with spines - this feature is unique and diagnostic. There are other toothed fungi but none that could be confused with this.

**Foraging Tip:** Often found in the same areas as chanterelles and porcini. A reliable and safe species for beginners.

### Hen of the Woods
*Grifola frondosa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Base of oak trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Hen of the Woods (also known as Maitake) forms large, spectacular, rosette-like clusters of overlapping fan-shaped caps at the base of oak trees. The entire fruiting body can be 20-60cm across and weigh several kilograms. Each individual cap is 2-7cm across, fan or spoon-shaped, grey-brown to greyish, with a finely wrinkled or textured surface.

The undersides have tiny white to cream pores. The caps arise from a branched, white basal stem structure. The flesh is white, firm when young, with a pleasant mushroomy smell. This fungus is parasitic and saprobic on oak, causing white rot. It fruits from the same location year after year.

**Culinary Value:** Highly prized in Japanese cuisine (maitake means "dancing mushroom"). Excellent flavor - rich, earthy, slightly spicy. Firm, meaty texture. Can be sautéed, grilled, roasted, added to soups and stir-fries. Young specimens are best. Older ones become tough. Well-known in medicinal mushroom research for immune-supporting properties.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Black-staining Polypore** (Meripilus giganteus) - Edible when young. Larger, fans stain black when touched
- **Umbrella Polypore** (Polyporus umbellatus) - Edible. More umbrell a-like arrangement

**Foraging Note:** A single hen of the woods can provide many pounds of excellent mushroom. Mark the location and return annually.

### Honey Fungus
*Armillaria mellea* (species complex)

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution (must be well-cooked)
- **Toxicity:** Toxic when raw or undercooked
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** On and around dead/dying trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None (when properly cooked)

**Identification:**
Honey Fungus is actually a complex of several similar species, all parasitic on trees. The cap is 3-15cm across, convex, colored honey-yellow to yellow-brown or darker brown, often with darker scales concentrated toward the center. The gills are white becoming cream or pinkish-brown with age, adnate to slightly decurrent, developing brown spots.

The stem is 5-20cm tall, 0.5-2cm thick, colored like cap or paler, with a ring that is woolly or cottony below. The base is often swollen. **Key feature:** The mushrooms grow in dense clusters on or around dead/dying trees and stumps. Underground, black bootlace-like rhizomorphs spread through soil.

The flesh is white, firm, with a distinctive smell (sometimes described as earthy or unpleasant). Honey Fungus is a serious tree pathogen causing root rot.

**Edibility Concerns:**
- **MUST be thoroughly cooked** (at least 15 minutes boiling or frying)
- Even when cooked, some people experience gastric upset
- Young caps are better than old
- Never eat stems (too tough)
- Try small amounts first
- Due to variable reactions, many foragers avoid this species

**Lookalikes:**
- **Funeral Bell** (Galerina marginata) - DEADLY. Smaller, rustier brown, no ring or ephemeral ring, different habitat
- **Deadly Webcap** (Cortinarius rubellus) - DEADLY. Different gills, no ring, conifer habitat

**WARNING:** Due to toxicity when undercooked and potential for confusion with deadly species, best avoided by beginners.

### Horse Mushroom
*Agaricus arvensis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, pastures, fields

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Horse Mushroom is a large, robust Agaricus and an excellent edible. The cap is 7-20cm across (occasionally larger), initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and sometimes flat. The cap is white to cream, smooth, sometimes developing fine brown scales toward center. The surface may yellow slightly when bruised.

**Critical identifying features:** The gills are free, starting white or pale grey, turning greyish-brown and finally chocolate-brown with spore maturity (never staying white). The stem is 6-15cm tall, 2-3cm thick, white, robust, with a bulbous base. There is a large, pendulous, double-edged ring (with cog-wheel pattern on underside). **No volva present.**

The flesh is thick, white, sometimes yellowing slightly when cut. **Distinctive aniseed smell** - this sweet, aniseed aroma is diagnostic and immediately distinguishes it from poisonous species.

Horse Mushrooms grow in unimproved grassland, pastures, meadows, and parkland, often in fairy rings. They prefer fields where horses graze (hence the name).

**Culinary Value:** Excellent edible mushroom with firm texture and good flavor, enhanced by the aniseed notes. Can be used in any mushroom dish. Particularly good grilled or roasted whole when young.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Bright chrome-yellow staining at stem base, chemical/phenolic smell (not anise)
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills stay white, has volva, sweet sickly smell (not anise)
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. Often greenish, white gills, has volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. **Smell test:** Must have pleasant aniseed smell (not chemical or phenolic)
2. **Gill color:** Must turn brown, never stay pure white
3. **Staining test:** Bruising may cause slight yellowing but NOT bright chrome-yellow
4. **Volva check:** No volva or bulb at base

### Ink Cap (Common/Shaggy)
*Coprinus comatus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible (young specimens only, avoid with alcohol)
- **Toxicity:** None (but interacts with alcohol)
- **Season:** Spring to autumn (April-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, roadsides, disturbed ground

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Shaggy Ink Cap (also called Lawyer's Wig) is distinctive and unmistakable. The young cap is 5-15cm tall, cylindrical to barrel-shaped, white, covered with shaggy, upturned scales that are white with brownish tips. As it matures, the cap expands and the gills begin to deliquesce (auto-digest) from the bottom upward, turning into black ink-like liquid. This happens within hours.

The gills are white when very young, quickly turning pink, then black as they deliquesce. The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, hollow, smooth, with a movable ring near the base that often falls off. The flesh is white, soft, fragile, with mild smell.

This species grows in grassland, lawns, roadsides, gardens, and disturbed ground, often appearing in troops after rain.

**Culinary Value:** Young specimens (before gills turn black) are excellent eating with delicate flavor and soft texture. They must be cooked soon after picking as they deliquesce rapidly. Sauté quickly in butter or add to soups. Once the gills start to turn pink or black, they are past eating stage.

**IMPORTANT WARNING:** While this species is safe, it contains traces of coprine (though much less than the Common Ink Cap). Do NOT consume alcohol within 48 hours before or after eating. The interaction can cause coprine syndrome (flushing, nausea, rapid heartbeat).

**Lookalikes:**
- **Magpie Ink Cap** (Coprinopsis picacea) - Edible. Black and white patches, less shaggy
- Young specimens are distinctive and unlikely to be confused

**Safety Note:** Only eat young, fresh specimens with white gills. Avoid if consuming alcohol.

- **Season:** Year-round (all seasons)
- **Habitat:** Elder trees (also other hardwoods)

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Jelly Ear is a distinctive ear-shaped fungus with a gelatinous texture. The fruiting body is 3-10cm across, ear or cup-shaped, sometimes lobed, attached laterally to the wood. The outer (upper) surface is smooth to slightly wrinkled, colored reddish-brown to purplish-brown. The inner surface has a velvety texture with finer wrinkles and veins, colored similarly or paler.

The texture is rubbery-gelatinous when fresh, becoming hard and horny when dried (but reviving when soaked). There is no stem. The flesh is thin, translucent, jelly-like. Jelly Ear grows primarily on elder (Sambucus) but also appears on other deciduous trees, particularly beech, sycamore, and ash.

**Culinary Value:** Popular in Asian cuisine (known as Wood Ear or Cloud Ear fungus). The texture is the main appeal - crunchy and gelatinous. Mild flavor. Used in soups, stir-fries, and hot and sour soup. Dries well and rehydrates easily. Requires thorough cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the ear shape and jelly texture on elder are distinctive.

**Foraging Note:** Can be found year-round but most abundant in autumn and winter. Often abundant when found.

### Larch Bolete
*Suillus grevillei*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Under larch trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Larch Bolete is a medium-sized bolete found exclusively under larch trees (Larix). The cap is 5-12cm across, convex, colored bright golden-yellow to orange-yellow or rusty-brown. The surface is smooth and very slimy when wet. The pore surface is yellow, bruising brownish, with large angular pores.

The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, yellow above the ring, white to pale yellow below, often with rusty-brown glandular dots. **Diagnostic feature:** There is a ring on the stem - unusual for boletes. The ring is white to cream, membranous, often collapsing against the stem.

The flesh is pale yellow, soft, often waterlogged. Smell is faint or fruity. This bolete forms mycorrhizal associations exclusively with larch, making identification certain if the tree identification is correct.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly rated. The slimy cap skin should be removed. The flesh is soft and watery. Better for mixing with other mushrooms than eating alone. Young, firm specimens are best.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Slippery Jack** (Suillus luteus) - Under pine, darker brown cap
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - No ring, under pine, smaller pores

### Lion's Mane
*Hericium erinaceus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Hardwood trees, especially beech and oak

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Lion's Mane is one of the most distinctive and unmistakable fungi. The fruiting body is 10-40cm across, forming a large, white, shaggy mass of long, cascading spines that truly resemble a lion's mane or a white pom-pom. The spines are 1-5cm long, soft, white when fresh, becoming yellowish with age. The entire fungus grows from a tough, branched base attached to the tree.

This fungus grows on dead or dying hardwood trees, particularly beech and oak, usually high up on trunks or large branches. It's relatively rare in the UK, making it a special find. The species is a white rot fungus causing decay of heartwood.

**Culinary Value:** Highly prized gourmet mushroom with exceptional flavor and texture. The taste is often compared to seafood - lobster or crab-like. Excellent sautéed in butter, breaded and fried, or in soups. The texture is meaty and slightly chewy. Young, fresh, white specimens are best. As it ages and yellows, it becomes bitter.

**Medicinal Interest:** Subject of research for potential neurological benefits, including nerve growth factor stimulation. Traditional use in Chinese medicine.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the cascading white spines are unique and unmistakable.

**Conservation Note:** Relatively uncommon in UK. Harvest sustainably and never take all fruiting bodies.

### Miller
*Clitopilus prunulus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but easily confused with toxic species)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Miller is a medium-sized white woodland mushroom. The cap is 3-10cm across, convex becoming flat with a wavy margin, often irregularly shaped. The surface is white to pale grey or cream, smooth to slightly silky. The gills are white when young, becoming flesh-pink as spores mature (this pink tinge is diagnostic), decurrent, crowded, easily separated from cap flesh.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, solid, often eccentric or off-center. The flesh is white, soft, with a **strong smell of fresh meal or wet flour** - this distinctive mealy smell is the key identification feature and gives the species its common name.

The spore print is distinctly pink - this is critical for confident identification.

**Edibility Concerns:** While edible, Miller is best avoided by beginners due to potential confusion with deadly species, particularly Fool's Funnel. The mealy smell and pink spore print are distinctive, but confident identification requires experience.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fool's Funnel** (Clitocybe rivulosa) - DEADLY. White spores (not pink), grassland habitat, less pronounced smell
- **Ivory Funnel** (Clitocybe dealbata) - DEADLY. White spores, grassland habitat
- **Clouded Funnel** (Clitocybe nebularis) - Edibility questionable. Larger, grey, strong fruity smell

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** Only eat after confirming:
1. Strong mealy smell
2. Pink spore print
3. Woodland habitat (not grassland)
4. Pink-tinged gills

- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Under birch trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Orange Birch Bolete is a striking bolete found exclusively with birch trees. The cap is 8-20cm across, hemispherical to convex, colored bright orange-red to reddish-brown or rusty-orange. The cap margin typically overhangs the pores. The surface is smooth to slightly felty.

The pore surface is pale grey to cream when young, becoming brownish with age, bruising grey-brown. The tubes are deeply depressed around the stem apex. The stem is 10-20cm tall, 2-4cm thick, robust, white to pale grey, covered with small black or dark grey scales (scabers) that roughen the surface. The stem base is often swollen and may show blue-green staining.

The flesh is white, firm when young, turning grey-violet then black when cut (distinctive). This dramatic color change is characteristic. Must be cooked thoroughly.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly prized. The flesh becomes soft and watery when cooked and discolors dramatically to grey-black, which is unattractive but harmless. Young, firm specimens are better. The spongy pores should be removed from older specimens.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Brown Birch Bolete** (Leccinum scabrum) - Brown cap, less color change, same habitat
- Other Leccinum species - Various colors, all with scaly stems

### Orange Peel Fungus
*Aleuria aurantia*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible (but bland)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-December)
- **Habitat:** Disturbed soil, paths, bare ground

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 1
- **Saturation:** 0.2
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Orange Peel Fungus is a striking cup fungus that lives up to its name. The fruiting body is 1-10cm across, cup or saucer-shaped, sometimes irregular, with a split or wavy margin. The inner surface is bright orange to orange-red, smooth. The outer surface is paler orange to whitish, finely granular. The texture is brittle and fragile.

This fungus grows on disturbed soil, bare patches, paths, roadsides, and waste ground, often partially buried or emerging from soil. It has no stem. The flesh is thin, brittle, with no distinctive smell.

**Culinary Value:** Technically edible but not worthwhile. The flesh is thin and tasteless. Some people use it as a colorful garnish or in salads for appearance rather than flavor. Not toxic but offers little culinary value.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Scarlet Elf Cup** (Sarcoscypha coccinea) - Scarlet red (not orange), on wood, winter/spring

**Foraging Note:** More interesting as a colorful find than as food. The bright orange color makes it photogenic.

- **Season:** Autumn to spring (October-May)
- **Habitat:** Dead hardwood, especially beech

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Oyster Mushroom is an excellent edible species that grows in shelf-like clusters on dead hardwood. The cap is 5-25cm across, oyster or shell-shaped, smooth, colored greyish-brown to blue-grey when young, becoming paler brown or cream with age. Young specimens often have a bluish tinge. The surface is smooth, slightly moist.

The gills are white to cream, running down the short lateral stem, spaced moderately to widely. The stem is 1-4cm long (or absent), lateral to off-center, white, solid, tough at base. The flesh is white, thick, firm, with a pleasant mild smell and taste.

Oyster Mushrooms grow in overlapping clusters on dead or dying hardwood, especially beech, but also on ash, oak, and other broadleaf trees. They fruit from autumn through winter into early spring - unusual for edible mushrooms. The clusters can be quite large, producing several pounds of mushroom.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom, popular in commercial cultivation. Firm, meaty texture with a subtle, mild, slightly anise-like flavor. Can be sautéed, stir-fried, roasted, grilled, or added to soups and stews. Particularly good in Asian-style dishes. The stems are tough and should be trimmed. Must be cooked - never eat raw.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Bitter Oysterling** (Panellus stipticus) - INEDIBLE. Much smaller, very bitter taste, tougher texture
- **Angel Wings** (Pleurocybella porrigens) - On conifer wood, pure white, thinner. Toxicity concerns - avoid

**Safety Check:** Taste a small piece raw and spit out - should be mild, not bitter. If bitter, it's not Oyster Mushroom.

### Panther Cap
*Amanita pantherina*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous and coniferous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison III (800 ticks), Confusion III (1000 ticks), Wither I (600 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Panther Cap is seriously poisonous and has caused fatalities. It's often confused with the edible (when cooked) Blusher, with tragic results.**

Panther Cap is a medium-sized Amanita. The cap is 5-12cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap is grey-brown to dark brown, covered with pure white warts arranged in concentric rings - these warts are remnants of the universal veil and can wash off in rain. The cap margin is distinctly striated.

The gills are pure white, free from the stem, crowded. The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical, with a bulbous base. The ring is white, pendulous, thin. **Critical feature:** The bulb at the base has a distinct marginate (collared) edge where the volva forms a distinct rim or collar around the top of the bulb - this is diagnostic.

The flesh is white, with no distinctive smell. **Does NOT stain red or pink** - this distinguishes it from the Blusher.

**TOXICITY:** Contains high levels of muscimol and ibotenic acid (similar to Fly Agaric but more concentrated):
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion
- Confusion, dizziness, loss of coordination
- Hallucinations, delirium, agitation
- Seizures possible
- Loss of consciousness
- Can be fatal, especially in children
- Effects last 4-10 hours

**Lookalikes:**
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - EDIBLE when cooked. Pinkish warts, stains red when damaged, no marginate bulb
- **Grey Spotted Amanita** (Amanita spissa) - Grey warts, stains grey, no marginate bulb

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The marginate (collared) bulb and pure white ring, combined with striated cap margin and NO red staining, are diagnostic. If in any doubt, AVOID all brown-capped Amanitas.

**WARNING:** Several deaths have resulted from confusion with Blusher. Never eat any Amanita unless you are absolutely certain.

- **Habitat:** Grassland, woodland edges, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Parasol is a large, impressive, and excellent edible mushroom. The cap is 10-25cm across (occasionally up to 40cm), initially egg or drum-shaped, expanding to flat with a prominent central umbo. The cap surface is pale cream to buff with large, flat, brown scales arranged in a shaggy pattern, most dense at the center.

The gills are white to cream, free from the stem (with a collar of space), soft, crowded. The stem is 15-30cm tall, 1-2cm thick, very tall and slender, white to grey-brown with brown snakeskin markings (zigzag pattern). The ring is large, thick, double-edged, and movable - you can slide it up and down the stem. The base is slightly bulbous.

The flesh is white, soft, with a pleasant nutty smell and taste. Parasols grow in grassland, woodland edges, parks, and gardens, often appearing singly or in small groups.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom. The cap has excellent flavor - rich, nutty, and meaty. The cap can be prepared like a schnitzel: breaded and fried whole, or sliced and sautéed. The stem is tough and fibrous and should be discarded. Young specimens (before cap opens fully) are best. Only the cap should be eaten.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE but can cause reactions. Smaller, stains orange-red when cut
- **Deadly Dapperling** (Lepiota brunneoincarnata) - DEADLY. Much smaller (cap under 7cm), pinkish scales
- Other small Lepiota species - MANY ARE TOXIC. Never eat small (<10cm cap) mushrooms with free gills and scales

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** Only eat large Parasols with caps over 10cm. The tall stem with snakeskin pattern and movable ring are distinctive. **Never eat small Lepiotas - they can be deadly.**

- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Beech trees only

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Porcelain Fungus is a delicate, beautiful mushroom found exclusively on beech trees. The cap is 2-8cm across, convex to flat, semi-translucent, colored white to pale grey or cream with a translucent, striated margin. The surface is smooth and covered with thick, slimy mucus when moist - extremely slippery and gelatinous.

The gills are white, widely spaced, adnexed, thick. The stem is 4-10cm tall, slender, white above a ring, darker grey-brown below, with a distinct ring that is slimy on the underside. The flesh is white, thin, with no distinctive smell.

This mushroom grows on living beech trunks and branches, often high up, in clusters. The combination of slimy cap, translucent appearance, and exclusive beech association makes it distinctive.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not particularly worthwhile. The flesh is thin and the cap is very slimy. Some people enjoy it for the interesting texture. The slime should be rinsed off or the caps dried before cooking. Mild flavor.

**Lookalikes:**
None on beech with this slimy, translucent appearance.

**Identification:**
Reishi is a distinctive bracket fungus with a kidney or fan-shaped cap and often a lateral stem. The cap is 5-30cm across, semi-circular to kidney-shaped, with a shiny, lacquered appearance when fresh. The surface is marked with concentric zones of color ranging from red-brown to orange-brown to yellow, with a white to cream growing margin. The surface develops a hard, varnished crust.

The underside has tiny white to cream pores that bruise brown. The stem (when present) is lateral, 5-15cm long, dark brown to black, varnished like the cap. The flesh is corky, tough, pale brown, woody. This fungus grows at the base of hardwood trees and stumps, particularly oak.

**Medicinal Properties:** Reishi is one of the most famous medicinal mushrooms, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for over 2,000 years:
- Immune system modulation
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Potential anti-cancer properties (ongoing research)
- Cardiovascular support
- Stress reduction and sleep support

**Preparation:** Too woody to eat. Sliced and simmered for hours to make medicinal tea, or processed into extracts and supplements. The tea is bitter.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Artist's Bracket** (Ganoderma applanatum) - Hoof-shaped, grey-brown upper surface, not varnished
- Other Ganoderma species - Various appearances

### Russula Species (Generic Entry for Multiple Edible Russulas)

**Note:** There are dozens of Russula species in the UK. Many are edible, some are inedible due to peppery taste, and none are deadly. The safe rule for Russulas is: **Mild taste = edible. Peppery/hot taste = inedible.**

General identification: Brittlegills (Russula) have caps that are typically brightly colored (red, purple, yellow, green, etc.), with brittle, chalk-like flesh that snaps cleanly. Gills are brittle and fairly rigid (not flexible). Most are mycorrhizal with trees.

**Safe edible Russulas include:**
- **Charcoal Burner** (already detailed)
- **Bare-toothed Russula** (R. vesca) - edible, reddish cap with bare margin
- **Green-cracking Russula** (R. virescens) - edible, green cap that cracks
- **Yellow Swamp Russula** (R. claroflava) - edible, bright yellow, with birch

**Inedible Russulas include:**
- **Sickener** (R. emetica) - poisonous, red cap, very hot taste
- **Beechwood Sickener** (already detailed)
- Most red Russulas are either hot-tasting or uncertain

**Safety Rule:** Always taste-test Russulas (nibble and spit out - do not swallow). If mild taste, proceed with caution. If hot/peppery, discard.

### Saffron Milk Cap
*Lactarius deliciosus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Pine woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Saffron Milk Cap is a distinctive and prized edible milk cap mushroom. The cap is 4-14cm across, convex becoming flat with a depressed center and inrolled margin. The surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored bright orange to orange-red with concentric zones of darker orange-red. The cap develops green stains with age or damage.

**Diagnostic feature:** When cut or damaged, the flesh exudes a bright orange to carrot-orange latex (milk). This orange milk is distinctive. The gills are orange, crowded, decurrent, staining green when damaged. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, orange with darker orange depressions or pits, hollow.

The flesh is firm, orange, staining green slowly. It has a mild smell and taste. Saffron Milk Cap grows under pine trees (Pinus), forming mycorrhizal associations.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom, especially in Mediterranean and Eastern European cuisine. Firm texture and distinctive, slightly fruity flavor. Excellent grilled, fried, pickled, or roasted. The green staining is harmless and occurs with cooking. Can cause harmless orange coloration of urine.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Saffron Milk Cap** (Lactarius deterrimus) - Edible. Under spruce, milk reddens slowly
- **Woolly Milk Cap** (Lactarius torminosus) - POISONOUS. Pale pink, hairy cap margin, white milk

**Safety Check:** The orange milk is diagnostic. If milk is white, it's not Saffron Milk Cap.

### Scarlet Elf Cup
*Sarcoscypha coccinea*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible (too tough)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Winter to spring (December-April)
- **Habitat:** Dead wood in damp locations

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Scarlet Elf Cup is a stunning bright red cup fungus that brightens winter woodlands. The fruiting body is 1-6cm across, cup or goblet-shaped, brilliant scarlet-red on the inner surface, paler pinkish-white and slightly hairy on the outer surface. The cup is supported by a short white stem.

This fungus grows on dead sticks and branches buried in leaf litter or moss, often in damp, shaded locations. It fruits in winter and early spring when few other mushrooms are present, making it a welcome splash of color.

**Culinary Value:** Not edible due to tough, rubbery texture, though not toxic. Some sources suggest it's been used as decoration on cakes or drinks, but it's too tough to eat.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Orange Peel Fungus** (Aleuria aurantia) - Orange not red, on soil, autumn
- **Scarlet Caterpillar fungus** (Cordyceps militaris) - On buried insect larvae

**Foraging Note:** Beautiful to photograph but not useful for eating. An indicator of healthy woodland with plenty of deadwood.

### Shaggy Parasol
*Chlorophyllum rhacodes*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but causes reactions in some people)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, gardens, compost

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Shaggy Parasol is similar to but smaller than the true Parasol. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially drum-shaped, expanding to flat with or without a low umbo. The surface is white to pale cream with large, shaggy, brown scales that curl upward, most dense at center. The scales are more prominent than Parasol.

The gills are white to cream, free with a collar, crowded. **Critical feature:** The gills and flesh stain orange-red to reddish-brown when cut or bruised - this is diagnostic and distinguishes it from Parasol. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, smooth or with fine scales, white, with a movable ring. The base is bulbous.

The flesh is white, staining orange-red when cut, with a pleasant smell. Shaggy Parasol grows in woodland, gardens, parks, and compost heaps.

**Edibility Concerns:** While considered edible, Shaggy Parasol causes gastric upset in a significant number of people (estimated 10-20%). Reactions include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurring 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating. Some people eat it with no problems while others consistently react badly. **Always try small amounts first if testing this species.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. Larger, no orange-red staining, snakeskin stem pattern
- **Deadly Dapperling** (Lepiota brunneoincarnata) - DEADLY. Much smaller (under 7cm cap)
- **Green-spored Parasol** (Chlorophyllum molybdites) - POISONOUS. Green gills when mature

**WARNING:** Due to individual sensitivity and risk of confusion, many foragers avoid this species. The orange-red staining is diagnostic but doesn't make it safe for everyone.

### Slippery Jack
*Suillus luteus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Pine woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Slippery Jack is a common bolete under pine trees. The cap is 5-12cm across, convex to flat, colored chocolate-brown to purple-brown or reddish-brown. The surface is very slimy when wet (hence "slippery") - the slime can be peeled off. The pore surface is yellow, bruising slightly brownish, with small round pores.

**Diagnostic feature:** The stem has a large, prominent ring that is whitish above and purple-brown and slimy below. This ring with purple-brown undersurface is diagnostic. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white to yellowish above the ring, brownish below, often with brown glandular dots.

The flesh is white to pale yellow, soft, with faint smell. Slippery Jack grows exclusively under pine trees (Pinus), forming mycorrhizal associations.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly regarded. The slimy cap skin should be removed before cooking. The flesh is soft and can be watery. Some people experience mild gastric upset. Best mixed with other mushrooms. Young specimens are better.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Larch Bolete** (Suillus grevillei) - Under larch, golden-yellow cap, ring less slimy
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - No ring, smaller, paler

### Stinkhorn
*Phallus impudicus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible (egg stage only)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, gardens, mulch

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 1
- **Saturation:** 0.2
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Stinkhorn is one of the most distinctive and bizarrely-shaped fungi. It starts as a white "egg" (3-6cm across) partially buried in soil or leaf litter. This egg ruptures and rapidly (within a few hours) extends a white, spongy, hollow stem (10-25cm tall) topped with a dark olive-brown, bell-shaped, honeycombed head covered in slimy, foul-smelling spore mass.

**The smell is the key feature:** When mature, Stinkhorn produces an incredibly strong, putrid smell like rotting flesh or sewage. This attracts flies which disperse the spores. The smell can be detected from many meters away. The stem is white, hollow, spongy. After flies remove the spore mass, the head appears yellowish and honeycomb-patterned.

**Edibility:** Only the egg stage is edible (before the stem emerges). The eggs have a radish-like flavor and are considered a delicacy in some European and Asian countries. Once the stem emerges and the smell develops, it's not eaten (though not toxic).

**Culinary Note:** Stinkhorn eggs are eaten raw or cooked in parts of Eastern Europe and China. They must be identified by cutting open to show the developing stinkhorn inside the jelly-like egg.

**Lookalikes (egg stage):**
- **Immature Amanitas** - POTENTIALLY DEADLY. Cut open - if it shows developing gills and cap structure (not stinkhorn), AVOID
- **Earthballs** - Purple-black inside when cut

**Safety Rule:** Only eat if you're certain it's a stinkhorn egg by cutting it open lengthwise to reveal the developing structure.

### Stump Puffball
*Lycoperdon pyriforme*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible (only when pure white inside)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-December)
- **Habitat:** Dead wood, stumps

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Stump Puffball is a small pear-shaped puffball that grows in dense clusters on dead wood - this wood-inhabiting habitat immediately distinguishes it from most other puffballs. Each fruiting body is 2-4cm tall, 1.5-3cm wide, pear-shaped or top-shaped with a narrower base that has white root-like rhizomorphs (cords) attached.

The surface is pale brown to ochre, covered with small granules or warts when young, becoming smoother with age. **Critical edibility check:** When cut open, the interior must be pure white and homogeneous to be edible. Once it turns yellow or develops olive-brown spores, it's past edible stage.

When mature, the top develops a small opening through which spores puff out. The spores are olive-brown. Stump Puffballs grow in dense clusters on stumps, logs, and buried wood of deciduous trees.

**Culinary Value:** Edible when young and white inside, but small size and thin flesh make them less worthwhile than larger puffballs. Mild flavor. Can be sliced and fried. The clusters can provide a decent quantity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Puffball** (Lycoperdon perlatum) - On ground, not on wood, more spiny
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Thick skin, purple-black inside, not on wood

**Safety Rule:** Only eat when interior is pure white. The wood-growing habit is distinctive.

### Sulphur Tuft
*Hypholoma fasciculare*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Year-round (peak autumn)
- **Habitat:** Dead wood, stumps

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (600 ticks), Confusion I (400 ticks)

**Identification:**
Sulphur Tuft is a very common poisonous mushroom that grows in dense clusters on dead wood. The cap is 2-7cm across, bell-shaped to convex, colored bright sulphur-yellow to greenish-yellow with an orange-brown center. The gills start sulphur-yellow, becoming greenish and finally purplish-brown to purple-black as spores mature - this purple-brown gill color is diagnostic.

The stem is 4-10cm tall, thin, hollow, yellow above, rusty-brown below, often curved. The flesh is yellow, thin, with a very bitter taste (never swallow when taste-testing). There may be faint remnants of a ring zone on the stem.

Sulphur Tuft grows in large, dense clusters on stumps, logs, and buried wood of deciduous trees, occasionally on conifers. It's extremely common and fruits almost year-round but peaks in autumn.

**TOXICITY:** Contains toxins that cause severe gastric distress:
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually not fatal but very unpleasant
- Duration 6-24 hours

**Lookalikes:**
- **Brick Caps** (Hypholoma lateritium) - Edibility uncertain. Brick-red to orange-brown cap, less yellow
- **Honey Fungus** (Armillaria species) - Edible with caution. Honey-brown, true ring, different gills

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The combination of bright yellow color, clusters on wood, and greenish then purple-black gills is diagnostic. The very bitter taste (test and spit) confirms it. Never eat yellow mushrooms growing in clusters on wood unless expert identification.

### Tawny Grisette
*Amanita fulva*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but must never be eaten raw)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-October)
- **Habitat:** Mixed woodland, especially birch

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Tawny Grisette is similar to the Grisette but with a distinctive orange-brown color. The cap is 4-10cm across, initially conical, expanding to flat, with a deeply grooved or striated margin. The cap is orange-brown to tawny-brown, smooth, sometimes with white veil remnants.

The gills are white, free, crowded. **Critical feature:** There is NO ring on the stem - this immediately distinguishes it from most dangerous Amanitas. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white to pale orange-brown, slender, fragile, hollow, with orange-brown snakeskin patterns. The base sits in a large, loose, white to ochre volva sac.

The flesh is white, thin, fragile. Tawny Grisette grows in mixed woodland, especially with birch.

**Safety Note:** While edible when thoroughly cooked, this species is easily confused with deadly Amanitas by beginners. The lack of ring is distinctive. **Must be cooked - toxic when raw.** Due to confusion potential and mediocre quality, best avoided unless expert.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, often greenish
- **Grisette** (Amanita vaginata) - Edible. Grey cap, otherwise similar

- **Habitat:** Coniferous woodland, especially pine

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (400 ticks), Confusion I (300 ticks)

**Identification:**
The Sickener is a medium-sized Russula with a brilliant red cap. The cap is 4-10cm across, convex to flat, often with a depressed center. The surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored bright cherry-red to scarlet-red, sometimes fading to pinkish. The cap skin peels easily halfway to the center. The gills are white to pale cream, brittle, fairly widely spaced.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical, firm. The flesh is white, brittle, snapping cleanly like chalk. **Critical feature:** The taste is intensely hot and peppery - this burning, acrid taste appears immediately when a small piece is chewed (spit out - do not swallow).

The Sickener grows in coniferous woodland, particularly with pine, forming mycorrhizal associations. It's one of the hot-tasting Russulas.

**TOXICITY:** Contains unknown irritant compounds that cause:
- Severe vomiting and diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually resolves in 6-12 hours
- Not fatal but very unpleasant (hence "Sickener")

**Lookalikes:**
- **Charcoal Burner** (Russula cyanoxantha) - EDIBLE. Variable colors including purple/lilac, mild taste, greasy gills
- Other red Russulas - Many exist; use taste test to determine edibility

**Safety Rule for all Russulas:** Always taste-test (nibble and spit). If hot/peppery, it's inedible. If mild, it's potentially edible (though still confirm species).

### Turkey Tail
*Trametes versicolor*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Medicinal Only
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead hardwood

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A (medicinal only)
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None (used in crafting)

**Identification:**
Turkey Tail is one of the most common bracket fungi, named for its resemblance to a wild turkey's tail feathers. The brackets are 3-10cm across, thin, semi-circular to fan-shaped, growing in overlapping tiers on dead logs and stumps. The upper surface shows concentric zones of color including bands of brown, grey, orange, cream, and sometimes blue or green. The surface is finely velvety to smooth.

The underside has tiny cream-colored pores (3-5 per mm). The brackets are thin (1-3mm), flexible when fresh, becoming hard when dry. There is no stem. The flesh is thin, tough, whitish. Turkey Tail is extremely common on dead deciduous wood, especially beech, oak, and birch.

- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Winter (November-March)
- **Habitat:** Dead hardwood, especially elm

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Velvet Shank is a valuable winter mushroom, fruiting when few other edible species are available. The cap is 2-8cm across, convex to flat, smooth, very sticky or slimy when wet, colored orange-yellow to orange-brown, paler at margin. The gills are pale cream to yellowish, adnexed, fairly widely spaced.

**Diagnostic feature:** The stem has a distinctive dark velvety texture, especially toward the base - black-brown to dark purple-brown velvety coating on the lower stem. The upper stem is paler. The stem is 3-8cm tall, tough and fibrous. The flesh is white to yellowish, thin, with mild smell.

Velvet Shank grows in clusters on dead or dying hardwood, particularly elm, oak, and beech. It's one of few mushrooms that fruits during winter frosts - it can survive freezing and thaw out undamaged.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom - this is the wild relative of the cultivated Enoki mushroom (though wild specimens look very different from the pale, elongated cultivated version). Good flavor and texture. The stems are tough and should be discarded - only use caps. Must be cooked thoroughly.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Deadly Funeral Bell** (Galerina marginata) - DEADLY. Rusty-brown spores, no black velvet stem, usually on conifer wood
- **Sulphur Tuft** (Hypholoma fasciculare) - POISONOUS. More yellow, greenish gills, bitter taste

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The black velvety stem and winter fruiting season help identification. Always verify the dark velvety stem texture.

- **Habitat:** Woodland, gardens, compost

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None (when cooked)

**Identification:**
Wood Blewit is a distinctive mushroom colored in shades of blue-lilac when young. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flat, often wavy-margined. The color is lilac-blue to purple-blue when young and fresh, fading to buff-brown with age (but usually retaining some lilac tones). The surface is smooth, matt, slightly greasy when wet.

The gills are lilac to purple-pink, crowded, sinuate (notched), developing rusty spots with age. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1.5-3cm thick, stout, colored like the cap or paler lilac, often with a slightly bulbous base. The flesh is thick, firm, lilac-tinged, with a distinctive sweet, fruity, slightly perfumed smell.

Wood Blewit grows in woodland, woodland edges, gardens, and parks, often on compost or mulch. It fruits in troops or rings in late autumn and early winter, often persisting after frosts.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible with firm texture and distinctive flavor. The flavor is rich and slightly perfumed. Excellent in risottos, pasta dishes, or sautéed. The stems are good to eat (unlike many species). **MUST be cooked thoroughly** - causes gastric upset if eaten raw or undercooked.

**Edibility Concerns:** Some people experience reactions even when cooked. Try small amounts first. Never eat raw.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Lilac Webcap** (Cortinarius traganus) - INEDIBLE. Rusty-brown spores (not pink-buff), unpleasant smell
- **Violet Webcap** (Cortinarius violaceus) - Unknown edibility. Darker violet, rusty spores
- **Wood Woolly-foot** (Collybia peronata) - Different structure, woodland

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** The combination of lilac color, pink-buff spores, and fruity smell confirms Wood Blewit. Take a spore print to confirm pale pink-buff color (not rusty-brown).

### Wood Mushroom
*Agaricus sylvicola*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous and mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Wood Mushroom is an Agaricus species found in woodland. The cap is 5-10cm across, convex to flat, white to cream, sometimes yellowing when bruised. The surface is smooth, dry to slightly silky. The gills are free, initially pale pink-grey, becoming chocolate-brown with spore maturity (never staying white).

The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slender, with a prominent hanging ring. The base is slightly bulbous. No volva present. The flesh is white, thin, often yellowing slightly when cut. **Smell is distinctive:** pleasant aniseed or almond aroma.

Wood Mushroom grows in coniferous and mixed woodland, unlike its grassland relatives (Field and Horse Mushrooms). The woodland habitat and aniseed smell are key identification features.

**Culinary Value:** Good edible mushroom with pleasant flavor enhanced by anise notes. Similar in use to Field and Horse Mushrooms. The flesh is more delicate.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Bright chrome-yellow staining at stem base, chemical smell
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills stay white, has volva
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. Often greenish, white gills, has volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. Aniseed smell (not chemical or sickly-sweet)
2. Gills turn pink then brown
3. No volva at base
4. Slight yellowing okay, but NOT bright chrome-yellow

### Yellow Stainer
*Agaricus xanthodermus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, gardens, woodland edges

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison I (400 ticks), Confusion I (300 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Yellow Stainer is the most common cause of mushroom poisoning in the UK. It closely resembles edible field and horse mushrooms, leading to frequent misidentification.**

Yellow Stainer looks very similar to edible Agaricus species. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flat, white to cream, smooth. The gills are free, starting white, turning pink then chocolate-brown with spore maturity. The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1.5-2cm thick, white, with a ring. There is no volva.

**DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:**
1. **Bright chrome-yellow staining:** When the cap surface or stem base is scratched, rubbed, or bruised, it immediately stains bright chrome-yellow (like a yellow highlighter pen). This staining is the key identification feature.
2. **Chemical smell:** The mushroom has an unpleasant chemical smell like phenol, ink, or disinfectant - especially noticeable when cooking. This is completely different from the pleasant mushroom smell of edible Agaricus species or the aniseed smell of Horse Mushroom.

Yellow Stainer grows in grassland, pastures, gardens, parks, and woodland edges - the same habitats as edible species.

**TOXICITY:** Contains phenolic compounds that cause:
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually resolves in 6-24 hours
- Rarely serious but very unpleasant
- Some people are more sensitive than others

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - EDIBLE. Pleasant smell, no yellowing or only slight yellowing
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - EDIBLE. Aniseed smell, may yellow slightly but not bright chrome-yellow
- **Wood Mushroom** (Agaricus sylvicola) - EDIBLE. Aniseed smell, slight yellowing

**CRITICAL SAFETY TESTS:**
1. **Staining test:** Press stem base firmly - if it turns bright chrome-yellow, DO NOT EAT
2. **Smell test:** If it smells chemical, phenolic, or like ink, DO NOT EAT
3. **Cooking test:** The chemical smell intensifies dramatically when cooking

**Rule:** When collecting Agaricus mushrooms, ALWAYS perform the staining and smell tests. Yellow Stainer is the main reason to be cautious with white mushrooms.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary of Mycological Terms

- **Adnate:** Gills broadly attached to stem
- **Adnexed:** Gills narrowly attached to stem
- **Annulus:** Ring on the stem (remnant of partial veil)
- **Decurrent:** Gills running down the stem
- **Free:** Gills not attached to stem
- **Hygrophanous:** Changes color with moisture content
- **Mycorrhizal:** Symbiotic relationship between fungus and plant roots
- **Reticulation:** Net-like pattern, usually on bolete stems
- **Saprobic:** Feeds on dead organic matter
- **Spore Print:** Pattern of spores deposited on paper, used for identification
- **Stipe:** Scientific term for stem
- **Umbo:** Central bump or raised area on cap
- **Volva:** Cup or sac at stem base (remnant of universal veil)

### Appendix B: How to Take a Spore Print

1. Remove stem from mushroom cap
2. Place cap gill/pore-side down on white paper (or half on white, half on black for pale spores)
3. Cover with a bowl or glass to prevent air currents
4. Leave for 4-24 hours
5. Remove cap carefully to reveal spore print
6. Note color precisely - this is a critical identification feature

### Appendix C: Foraging Ethics and Conservation

- **Never over-harvest:** Take no more than 1/3 of any population
- **Use a basket:** Allow spores to disperse as you walk
- **Cut, don't pull:** Some species prefer cutting; others are fine to pull - know your species
- **Leave some for wildlife:** Mushrooms are food sources for many animals
- **Respect property:** Only forage where you have permission
- **Know protected species:** Some rare fungi are legally protected in the UK
- **Learn the ecology:** Understanding mycorrhizal relationships helps conservation

### Appendix D: Preservation Methods

1. **Drying:** Best for boletes, morels, many others. Slice thin, air dry or use dehydrator at 40-50°C
2. **Freezing:** Sauté first, then freeze. Many species become mushy if frozen raw
3. **Pickling:** Good for firm species like chanterelles and parasols
4. **Salt preservation:** Traditional method for milk caps
5. **Powder:** Dry thoroughly, then grind to powder for seasoning
