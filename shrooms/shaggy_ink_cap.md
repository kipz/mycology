**Identification:**
Shaggy Ink Cap (also called Lawyer's Wig) is distinctive and unmistakable. The young cap is 5-15cm tall, cylindrical to barrel-shaped, white, covered with shaggy, upturned scales that are white with brownish tips. As it matures, the cap expands and the gills begin to deliquesce (auto-digest) from the bottom upward, turning into black ink-like liquid. This happens within hours.

The gills are white when very young, quickly turning pink, then black as they deliquesce. The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, hollow, smooth, with a movable ring near the base that often falls off. The flesh is white, soft, fragile, with mild smell.

This species grows in grassland, lawns, roadsides, gardens, and disturbed ground, often appearing in troops after rain.

**Culinary Value:** Young specimens (before gills turn black) are excellent eating with delicate flavor and soft texture. They must be cooked soon after picking as they deliquesce rapidly. Sauté quickly in butter or add to soups. Once the gills start to turn pink or black, they are past eating stage.

**IMPORTANT WARNING:** While this species is safe, it contains traces of coprine (though much less than the Common Ink Cap). Do NOT consume alcohol within 48 hours before or after eating. The interaction can cause coprine syndrome (flushing, nausea, rapid heartbeat).

**Lookalikes:**
- **Magpie Ink Cap** (Coprinopsis picacea) - Edible. Black and white patches, less shaggy
- Young specimens are distinctive and unlikely to be confused

**Safety Note:** Only eat young, fresh specimens with white gills. Avoid if consuming alcohol.
