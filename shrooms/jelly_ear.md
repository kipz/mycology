**Identification:**
Jelly Ear is a distinctive ear-shaped fungus with a gelatinous texture. The fruiting body is 3-10cm across, ear or cup-shaped, sometimes lobed, attached laterally to the wood. The outer (upper) surface is smooth to slightly wrinkled, colored reddish-brown to purplish-brown. The inner surface has a velvety texture with finer wrinkles and veins, colored similarly or paler.

The texture is rubbery-gelatinous when fresh, becoming hard and horny when dried (but reviving when soaked). There is no stem. The flesh is thin, translucent, jelly-like. Jelly Ear grows primarily on elder (Sambucus) but also appears on other deciduous trees, particularly beech, sycamore, and ash.

**Culinary Value:** Popular in Asian cuisine (known as Wood Ear or Cloud Ear fungus). The texture is the main appeal - crunchy and gelatinous. Mild flavor. Used in soups, stir-fries, and hot and sour soup. Dries well and rehydrates easily. Requires thorough cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the ear shape and jelly texture on elder are distinctive.

**Foraging Note:** Can be found year-round but most abundant in autumn and winter. Often abundant when found.
