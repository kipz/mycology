**Identification:**
The Blackedge Bonnet is a close relative of the toxic Mycena pura and can easily be confused with it unless gill edges are carefully inspected. The cap is 15-50mm across, hemispherical to bell-shaped, becoming flatter with age. The color ranges from date brown to pale dingy purplish brown or pale lilac-brown. The cap is translucent-striate (showing radiating lines when held to light), hygrophanous (changing color as it dries), and slightly slippery when moist.

**Critical feature:** The dark purple-black gill edges that give this mushroom its common name. The gills themselves are pale, but their edges are distinctly dark. The stem is similar in color to the cap, smooth, and hollow. The flesh is thin and fragile with a distinctive radish-like smell.

The species grows solitary or in small groups among vegetable debris under various deciduous trees but also on fallen needles in coniferous woods on calcareous soil. Most commonly found in beech litter.

**Edibility Warning:** This mushroom must be considered INEDIBLE and potentially poisonous. The closely related Mycena pura contains the deadly toxin muscarine, and M. pelianthina likely contains similar compounds. Ingestion can cause gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Even if occasionally listed as "edible but not worthwhile," the risk of confusion with toxic species and conflicting safety information makes this mushroom best avoided entirely.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Mycena pura** (Lilac Bonnet) - POISONOUS. Contains muscarine. Very similar but gill edges not dark
- **Mycena rosea** - Similar size and color but lacks dark gill edges
- **Other Mycena species** - Many small bonnets look similar. Always check for dark gill edges

**Key Distinction:** The dark purple-black edges of the gills are diagnostic. However, given the toxicity concerns and close similarity to poisonous species, this mushroom should never be consumed.
