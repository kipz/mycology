**Identification:**
Common Morel is one of the most prized and distinctive spring mushrooms. The fruiting body is 5-12cm tall, consisting of a distinctive honeycomb-like cap atop a stout hollow stem. The cap is 3-8cm tall and roughly oval to conical, completely covered with deep pits and ridges forming an irregular honeycomb or brain-like pattern. The ridges are paler buff to cream, while the pits are darker greyish-brown to yellowish-brown.

**Critical features:** The cap is **completely hollow** throughout, as is the stem - when cut vertically, the entire interior is one continuous hollow chamber. The cap margin is attached directly to the stem with no gap. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 2-3cm thick, white to cream, hollow, and often slightly grooved or textured. The flesh is thin, brittle, and has a pleasant fruity smell.

Morels appear in spring (March-May in UK) in various habitats: woodland edges, parks, gardens, old orchards, and disturbed ground. They particularly favor lime-rich soils and ash trees. They're notorious for appearing abundantly one year and then being absent for several years. Some foragers have success finding them where wood chip mulch has been spread. They form mycorrhizal associations with various trees.

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** Morels are **TOXIC when raw** and must be thoroughly cooked before eating. Raw morels contain hydrazine toxins that are destroyed by cooking. Symptoms of raw morel poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Some people also react to cooked morels, especially if eaten with alcohol - try small amounts first. Never eat morels with alcohol.

**Culinary Value:** When properly cooked, morels are gourmet mushrooms with a distinctive earthy, nutty, meaty flavor. They're excellent stuffed, sautéed in butter, in cream sauces, or with eggs. The hollow structure requires thorough washing to remove insects and soil. They dry exceptionally well.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Morel** (Gyromitra esculenta) - DEADLY. Brain-like, not honeycomb, cap not attached to stem, not hollow throughout
- True morels can be distinguished by the honeycomb pattern and completely hollow interior

**WARNING:** NEVER eat morels raw. NEVER eat false morels. Always cook thoroughly.
