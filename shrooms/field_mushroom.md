### Field Mushroom
*Agaricus campestris*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:field_mushroom`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, pastures, lawns

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Field Mushroom is the wild relative of the cultivated button mushroom and one of the best-known edible species. The cap is 3-10cm across, initially hemispherical with margin tucked under, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap is white to cream, sometimes with fine brownish scales toward the center, smooth and dry. Young specimens have a silky sheen.

**Critical identifying features:** The gills are free from the stem and show a distinctive color progression: **pink when young (button stage), becoming pink-brown, and finally dark chocolate-brown to blackish-brown when mature as spores are released.** This gill color change is diagnostic for edible Agaricus species and immediately distinguishes them from deadly white Amanitas (which have white gills throughout).

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, smooth, cylindrical, with a simple white ring that is often thin and may disappear with age. The stem base is not bulbous and there is **no volva (cup)** - this absence of volva immediately excludes deadly Amanitas. The flesh is white, sometimes faintly pink when cut, with a pleasant mushroom smell.

Field Mushrooms grow in unimproved grassland, pastures, lawns, and meadows, especially where horses or cattle graze. They often appear in rings or troops after rain in late summer and autumn. They have a saprobic ecology, feeding on organic matter in the soil.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom with a classic mushroom flavor - rich, earthy, and savory. Can be used in any dish: fried, grilled, in soups, sauces, on pizza, with eggs. Young specimens ("buttons") are best eaten raw in salads, while larger ones are better cooked. The dark gills can color dishes black, which is harmless but may be unattractive.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Stains bright yellow at stem base when pressed, chemical/ink smell
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills that stay white, volva, sweet smell
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. White gills, greenish cap often, volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. **Check gill color:** Must be pink to brown, NEVER pure white
2. **Check stem base:** No volva (cup), no bulb - stem base is level with ground
3. **Check for yellowing:** Press stem base - if it turns bright chrome yellow, it's poisonous Yellow Stainer
4. **Smell:** Pleasant mushroomy smell, not chemical or sickly-sweet

### Horse Mushroom
*Agaricus arvensis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:field_mushroom`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, pastures, fields

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.6
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Horse Mushroom is a large, robust Agaricus and an excellent edible. The cap is 7-20cm across (occasionally larger), initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and sometimes flat. The cap is white to cream, smooth, sometimes developing fine brown scales toward center. The surface may yellow slightly when bruised.

**Critical identifying features:** The gills are free, starting white or pale grey, turning greyish-brown and finally chocolate-brown with spore maturity (never staying white). The stem is 6-15cm tall, 2-3cm thick, white, robust, with a bulbous base. There is a large, pendulous, double-edged ring (with cog-wheel pattern on underside). **No volva present.**

The flesh is thick, white, sometimes yellowing slightly when cut. **Distinctive aniseed smell** - this sweet, aniseed aroma is diagnostic and immediately distinguishes it from poisonous species.

Horse Mushrooms grow in unimproved grassland, pastures, meadows, and parkland, often in fairy rings. They prefer fields where horses graze (hence the name).

**Culinary Value:** Excellent edible mushroom with firm texture and good flavor, enhanced by the aniseed notes. Can be used in any mushroom dish. Particularly good grilled or roasted whole when young.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Bright chrome-yellow staining at stem base, chemical/phenolic smell (not anise)
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills stay white, has volva, sweet sickly smell (not anise)
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. Often greenish, white gills, has volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. **Smell test:** Must have pleasant aniseed smell (not chemical or phenolic)
2. **Gill color:** Must turn brown, never stay pure white
3. **Staining test:** Bruising may cause slight yellowing but NOT bright chrome-yellow
4. **Volva check:** No volva or bulb at base

### Wood Mushroom
*Agaricus sylvicola*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:field_mushroom`
- **Edibility:** Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous and mixed woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Wood Mushroom is an Agaricus species found in woodland. The cap is 5-10cm across, convex to flat, white to cream, sometimes yellowing when bruised. The surface is smooth, dry to slightly silky. The gills are free, initially pale pink-grey, becoming chocolate-brown with spore maturity (never staying white).

The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slender, with a prominent hanging ring. The base is slightly bulbous. No volva present. The flesh is white, thin, often yellowing slightly when cut. **Smell is distinctive:** pleasant aniseed or almond aroma.

Wood Mushroom grows in coniferous and mixed woodland, unlike its grassland relatives (Field and Horse Mushrooms). The woodland habitat and aniseed smell are key identification features.

**Culinary Value:** Good edible mushroom with pleasant flavor enhanced by anise notes. Similar in use to Field and Horse Mushrooms. The flesh is more delicate.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Yellow Stainer** (Agaricus xanthodermus) - POISONOUS. Bright chrome-yellow staining at stem base, chemical smell
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. White gills stay white, has volva
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. Often greenish, white gills, has volva

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS:**
1. Aniseed smell (not chemical or sickly-sweet)
2. Gills turn pink then brown
3. No volva at base
4. Slight yellowing okay, but NOT bright chrome-yellow
