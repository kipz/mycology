**Identification:**
Artist's Bracket is a large, perennial polypore fungus that forms impressive hoof-shaped or semi-circular brackets on dead or dying hardwood trees, particularly beech, oak, and sycamore. The fruiting body can grow 10-50cm across and persist for many years, adding a new pore layer each season. The upper surface is hard, woody, and concentrically zoned with browns and grays, often with a crusty texture. The margin is typically white when actively growing.

The underside features a white to cream pore surface that instantly bruises dark brown when scratched - this characteristic gives the fungus its common name, as the bruising can be used to create artwork or notes. The pore surface oxidizes to brown within minutes of being touched. The flesh is brown, corky, and extremely tough. This fungus is too woody to be edible but has medicinal properties similar to Reishi. It's a white rot fungus that breaks down lignin in wood.

In traditional Chinese medicine, this species (known as Ling Chih) has been used for immune system support and anti-inflammatory purposes. The spores are brown and produced in vast quantities, often accumulating as a rusty-brown dust around the bracket.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Reishi** (Ganoderma lucidum) - More kidney-shaped, lacquered red-brown surface
- Other Ganoderma species - Require microscopy for certain identification
