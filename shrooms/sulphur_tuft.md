**Identification:**
Sulphur Tuft is a very common poisonous mushroom that grows in dense clusters on dead wood. The cap is 2-7cm across, bell-shaped to convex, colored bright sulphur-yellow to greenish-yellow with an orange-brown center. The gills start sulphur-yellow, becoming greenish and finally purplish-brown to purple-black as spores mature - this purple-brown gill color is diagnostic.

The stem is 4-10cm tall, thin, hollow, yellow above, rusty-brown below, often curved. The flesh is yellow, thin, with a very bitter taste (never swallow when taste-testing). There may be faint remnants of a ring zone on the stem.

Sulphur Tuft grows in large, dense clusters on stumps, logs, and buried wood of deciduous trees, occasionally on conifers. It's extremely common and fruits almost year-round but peaks in autumn.

**TOXICITY:** Contains toxins that cause severe gastric distress:
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually not fatal but very unpleasant
- Duration 6-24 hours

**Lookalikes:**
- **Brick Caps** (Hypholoma lateritium) - Edibility uncertain. Brick-red to orange-brown cap, less yellow
- **Honey Fungus** (Armillaria species) - Edible with caution. Honey-brown, true ring, different gills

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The combination of bright yellow color, clusters on wood, and greenish then purple-black gills is diagnostic. The very bitter taste (test and spit) confirms it. Never eat yellow mushrooms growing in clusters on wood unless expert identification.
