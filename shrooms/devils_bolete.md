**Identification:**
Devil's Bolete is a large, robust, and unmistakable bolete. The cap is 8-30cm across, hemispherical becoming convex, colored pale whitish-grey to dirty grey or yellowish-grey - never brown like edible boletes. The pore surface is **blood-red to orange-red** when young (diagnostic), fading to orange or yellow-orange with age. The pores bruise blue immediately when touched.

The stem is 5-15cm tall, 3-8cm thick, very stout and bulbous, colored yellow in the upper part, flushed or entirely covered with blood-red to orange-red coloration, especially in the middle and lower portions. This red-flushed stem is diagnostic. There is often a reddish network pattern on the stem. The flesh is pale yellow, turning very slightly blue when cut, with an unpleasant smell when mature (rancid or like carrion).

Devil's Bolete grows in warm, calcareous (chalky/limestone) areas under beech and oak in southern England. It's rare but distinctive. The combination of pale grey cap, red pores, and red-marked stem makes it unmistakable.

**TOXICITY:** Contains unknown toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress within 1-2 hours: violent vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Symptoms are serious but usually resolve within 24-48 hours. Not fatal in recorded cases but extremely unpleasant. Toxins are not destroyed by cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the red pores and stem immediately distinguish it from all edible boletes.

**Safety Rule:** **NEVER eat any bolete with red or orange pores.** While not all are severely toxic, none are worth risking.
