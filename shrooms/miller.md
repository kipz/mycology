**Identification:**
Miller is a medium-sized white woodland mushroom. The cap is 3-10cm across, convex becoming flat with a wavy margin, often irregularly shaped. The surface is white to pale grey or cream, smooth to slightly silky. The gills are white when young, becoming flesh-pink as spores mature (this pink tinge is diagnostic), decurrent, crowded, easily separated from cap flesh.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, solid, often eccentric or off-center. The flesh is white, soft, with a **strong smell of fresh meal or wet flour** - this distinctive mealy smell is the key identification feature and gives the species its common name.

The spore print is distinctly pink - this is critical for confident identification.

**Edibility Concerns:** While edible, Miller is best avoided by beginners due to potential confusion with deadly species, particularly Fool's Funnel. The mealy smell and pink spore print are distinctive, but confident identification requires experience.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fool's Funnel** (Clitocybe rivulosa) - DEADLY. White spores (not pink), grassland habitat, less pronounced smell
- **Ivory Funnel** (Clitocybe dealbata) - DEADLY. White spores, grassland habitat
- **Clouded Funnel** (Clitocybe nebularis) - Edibility questionable. Larger, grey, strong fruity smell

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** Only eat after confirming:
1. Strong mealy smell
2. Pink spore print
3. Woodland habitat (not grassland)
4. Pink-tinged gills
