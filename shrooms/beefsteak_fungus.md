**Identification:**
Beefsteak Fungus is one of the most distinctive bracket fungi due to its remarkable resemblance to a cut of raw meat. The fruiting body is 7-30cm across, tongue or fan-shaped, attached to the tree by a short lateral stem. The upper surface is reddish-brown to liver-colored with a rough, slightly sticky texture. The underside has cream-colored tubes (pores) that are unusual in being separate from each other rather than fused - this is a unique identifying characteristic among UK polypores.

The most striking feature is its flesh, which is thick, soft, and juicy with a meat-like texture. When cut, it oozes a blood-red liquid and shows marbled streaks like raw steak. Young specimens are more palatable, though the flesh is acidic and can be sharp-tasting. The acidity mellows somewhat with cooking. This fungus grows almost exclusively on oak (Quercus) and occasionally sweet chestnut (Castanea), usually on living trees where it causes brown rot of the heartwood.

While edible, Beefsteak Fungus is not highly rated due to its acidic, sour taste. Young specimens can be sliced thinly and used as a meat substitute or in salads, where the tartness is appreciated. The acidity content means it should be eaten in moderation. Some foragers soak it in milk or salt water to reduce acidity before cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the combination of meat-like appearance, bleeding red juice, and separate tubes makes this unmistakable.
