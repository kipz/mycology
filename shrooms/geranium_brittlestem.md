**Identification:**
The Geranium Brittlestem (also known as Red Edge Brittlestem) is a small to medium-sized mushroom with a cap typically 1.5-5cm in diameter. The cap is conical to bell-shaped when young, sometimes with a wavy and corrugated appearance (hence "corrugis"), ranging from light brown to dark brown in color. As the mushroom matures, the cap may expand but often retains some undulation.

The gills are attached to the cap, relatively crowded, free (not attached to the stem), starting white to pale gray and turning to pale gray or brownish as they mature. The stem is slender, typically 4-10cm in height and 3-8mm in diameter, white to pale, fragile and easily broken (hence "brittlestem").

This is a very common and widespread species which grows on dead wood, buried twigs, sticks, or wood chips. It's a common member of the fungal community of flowerbeds mulched with wood chip or shredded bark, appearing from spring through autumn.

**Edibility:**
*Psathyrella corrugis* is regarded as inedible or of little culinary value. While not known to be toxic, it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort if consumed. All members of the *Psathyrella* genus are generally considered inedible or worthless for eating.

**Distinctive Features:**
The wavy, corrugated cap is a key identifying feature when present, along with the habitat on wood chip mulch or buried wood. The fragile, brittle stem breaks easily if you try to pick it.

**Similar Species:**
Identifying *Psathyrella corrugis* can be challenging due to similarities with other *Psathyrella* species. Key features include the wavy and somewhat corrugated cap, free gills, and habitat preferences. The genus *Psathyrella* contains many similar-looking species that are difficult to tell apart without microscopy.

**Key Distinction:** The corrugated cap, growth on wood chips or buried wood, and extremely fragile stem are helpful identification features. However, many *Psathyrella* species look similar and require microscopic examination for certain identification.
