**Identification:**
**WARNING: Death Cap is responsible for more fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide than any other species. Half a cap can kill an adult. There is no antidote.**

The Death Cap is a medium to large Amanita. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially hemispher ical with the margin tucked under, expanding to convex and finally flat. The color varies from **pale greenish-yellow to olive-green to yellowish-brown**, sometimes almost white. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, and may have faint radial fibrils. Patches of veil remnants may be present but often wash off. The cap margin is not striated.

The gills are white, crowded, and free from the stem. **They remain white - never pink, brown, or rusty.** This is critical. The stem is 7-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slightly tapering upward, often with a faint snakeskin (zigzag) pattern. It has a large, pendulous, skirt-like ring (annulus) that is white with faint striations on the upper surface. **The base has a large, sac-like volva** (cup) that is often buried in soil - you must dig around the base to see it.

The flesh is white and has a mild smell when young, developing a sickly-sweet smell like honey or flowers as it ages. The taste is reportedly mild (NEVER TASTE THIS MUSHROOM).

**TOXICITY:** Death Cap contains amatoxins - these are cyclic peptides that inhibit RNA polymerase II, preventing protein synthesis and causing cell death, particularly in liver and kidney cells. **Symptoms appear 6-24 hours after eating** - by which time the toxins have been absorbed and damage is underway:
- Phase 1: Severe vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: Apparent recovery (1-2 days) - toxins still causing liver damage
- Phase 3: Liver and kidney failure (3-5 days), often fatal without liver transplant

**Even with immediate medical treatment, mortality rate is 10-20%. Cooking does NOT destroy the toxins.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - Gills turn pink then brown, no volva, pleasant smell
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - Gills turn greyish then brown, smells of aniseed, no volva
- Edible Amanitas (Blusher, Grisette) - Different colors, different volva structure, edibility questionable

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
1. **NEVER eat a mushroom with the combination: white gills + ring + volva**
2. **ALWAYS dig around the base to check for a volva**
3. **When in doubt, throw it out**
4. **Avoid all Amanitas unless you are an expert**
5. **If you suspect you've eaten Death Cap, GO TO HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY - don't wait for symptoms**
