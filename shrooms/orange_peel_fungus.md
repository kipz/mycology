**Identification:**
Orange Peel Fungus is a striking cup fungus that lives up to its name. The fruiting body is 1-10cm across, cup or saucer-shaped, sometimes irregular, with a split or wavy margin. The inner surface is bright orange to orange-red, smooth. The outer surface is paler orange to whitish, finely granular. The texture is brittle and fragile.

This fungus grows on disturbed soil, bare patches, paths, roadsides, and waste ground, often partially buried or emerging from soil. It has no stem. The flesh is thin, brittle, with no distinctive smell.

**Culinary Value:** Technically edible but not worthwhile. The flesh is thin and tasteless. Some people use it as a colorful garnish or in salads for appearance rather than flavor. Not toxic but offers little culinary value.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Scarlet Elf Cup** (Sarcoscypha coccinea) - Scarlet red (not orange), on wood, winter/spring

**Foraging Note:** More interesting as a colorful find than as food. The bright orange color makes it photogenic.
