**Identification:**
**WARNING: Fool's Funnel is deadly poisonous, containing high levels of muscarine. It has caused fatalities and is particularly dangerous because it grows in lawns where people may not expect deadly mushrooms.**

Fool's Funnel is a small to medium-sized white mushroom. The cap is 2-8cm across, initially convex, becoming flat and then funnel-shaped with age. The cap surface is white to cream or pale buff, smooth, sometimes with a frosted or powdery appearance. The margin is initially inrolled, becoming wavy. The cap can develop brownish spots with age.

The gills are white to cream, crowded, decurrent (running down the stem). The stem is 2-5cm tall, 0.5-1cm thick, white, equal or slightly swollen at base, fibrous. The flesh is white, thin, with a faint mealy or cucumber-like smell. There is no ring or volva.

Fool's Funnel grows in short grass in lawns, parks, playing fields, and grassland, often forming rings or lines. It frequently fruits alongside edible mushrooms like Field Mushrooms, making it particularly dangerous.

**TOXICITY:** Contains very high levels of muscarine:
- Symptoms appear within 15-30 minutes
- Excessive salivation, sweating, tearing
- Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Blurred vision, constricted pupils
- Slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing
- Can be fatal without treatment (atropine antidote available)

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fairy Ring Champignon** (Marasmius oreades) - EDIBLE. Tough stem, widely spaced gills, sweet smell
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - EDIBLE. Gills turn pink then brown
- **Miller** (Clitopilus prunulus) - EDIBLE. Mealy smell, gills turn pink, spore print pink

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** NEVER eat small white mushrooms from lawns and grassland unless you are absolutely certain of identification. The risk is too great.
