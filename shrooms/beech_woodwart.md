**Identification:**
Beech Woodwart is a hard, small, flask-shaped fungus that forms dense clusters of reddish-brown to blackish "beads" or "warts" on dead beech branches and logs. Each fruitbody is 5-20mm across, roughly spherical when young, becoming more irregular with age. The surface starts brick-red to reddish-brown when young and fresh, darkening to almost black with age. When mature, the entire surface is covered with tiny ostioles (pore-like openings) through which spores are released.

This fungus is a pyrenomycete, producing its spores inside tiny flask-shaped structures (perithecia) embedded in the stroma. When the surface is scratched or broken, it often releases a cloud of dark spores. The interior tissue is zoned concentrically in white and black layers. Beech Woodwart is specific to beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) and is one of the most common fungi found on dead beech wood in the UK.

It plays an important ecological role as a decomposer of deadwood but has no culinary or medicinal value. The hard, woody texture makes it completely inedible. However, it's an interesting species for identification practice and understanding fungal ecology.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Cramp Balls** (Daldinia concentrica) - Larger, more spherical, on ash wood
- Other Hypoxylon species - Require microscopy for certain identification
