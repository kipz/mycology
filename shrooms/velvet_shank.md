**Identification:**
Velvet Shank is a valuable winter mushroom, fruiting when few other edible species are available. The cap is 2-8cm across, convex to flat, smooth, very sticky or slimy when wet, colored orange-yellow to orange-brown, paler at margin. The gills are pale cream to yellowish, adnexed, fairly widely spaced.

**Diagnostic feature:** The stem has a distinctive dark velvety texture, especially toward the base - black-brown to dark purple-brown velvety coating on the lower stem. The upper stem is paler. The stem is 3-8cm tall, tough and fibrous. The flesh is white to yellowish, thin, with mild smell.

Velvet Shank grows in clusters on dead or dying hardwood, particularly elm, oak, and beech. It's one of few mushrooms that fruits during winter frosts - it can survive freezing and thaw out undamaged.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom - this is the wild relative of the cultivated Enoki mushroom (though wild specimens look very different from the pale, elongated cultivated version). Good flavor and texture. The stems are tough and should be discarded - only use caps. Must be cooked thoroughly.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Deadly Funeral Bell** (Galerina marginata) - DEADLY. Rusty-brown spores, no black velvet stem, usually on conifer wood
- **Sulphur Tuft** (Hypholoma fasciculare) - POISONOUS. More yellow, greenish gills, bitter taste

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The black velvety stem and winter fruiting season help identification. Always verify the dark velvety stem texture.
