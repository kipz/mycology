- **Toxicity:** None

**Identification:**
The Hoof Fungus, also known as Tinder Fungus, forms large bracket fruiting bodies shaped like a horse's hoof. The brackets can grow up to 45cm across and 25cm thick, making them one of the larger polypores. The fruiting bodies are perennial, building a new layer each year, resulting in their characteristic layered appearance.

**Upper Surface:** Varies in color from silvery grey to almost black, though normally brown. The outer surface is very hard with concentric semicircular ridges resulting from annual growth zones. The texture feels almost like touching hardwood.

**Underside:** Consists of a dense concentration of tubes or pores that are cream or pale brown in color, about 0.3mm across. The pore surface is the fertile layer where spores are produced.

**Flesh (Trama):** Quite dense and firm in consistency with a cinnamon-brown color. The texture is tough and corky, becoming very hard when dry.

**Distribution in UK:** Rare in southern Britain and Ireland; common in Scotland and northern mainland Europe. However, it occurs in much of mainland Scotland, but is most abundant in the Highlands.

**Host Trees:** This large bracket fungus attacks mainly birch but occasionally beech and sycamore. It grows on dead Silver Birch and Beech, increasingly common on Beech the further south you go.

**Historical Uses:**
Despite being inedible, this fungus has immense historical importance:
- **Tinder:** The inner layer can be processed into amadou, an excellent fire-starting material used for thousands of years
- **Medicine:** Used in traditional medicine for various ailments
- **Leather substitute:** Amadou can be processed into a suede-like material

**Similar Species:**
Other bracket fungi, particularly of the genus *Phellinus* and *Ganoderma*, can look similar. However, the hoof shape, very hard outer crust, and cinnamon-colored flesh are distinctive.

**Key Distinction:** The characteristic horse-hoof shape, very hard woody texture, concentric growth rings, and host tree (usually birch) make this species relatively easy to identify.
