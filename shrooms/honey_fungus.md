**Identification:**
Honey Fungus grows in dense clusters on dead or dying wood at the base of trees. The caps are 5-15cm in diameter when fully opened, honey-yellow but can also be reddish-brown, with a consistent darker area near the center made up of densely packed scales. The cap starts convex and flattens with age.

The gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, white to cream, becoming spotted or stained brown with age. The stem is 6-15cm tall and 5-15mm in diameter, with a distinctive white to yellowish ring on the upper portion. The stem is often honey-colored like the cap.

**Critical identifying feature:** Thick, bootlace-like networks called rhizomorphs (black, shiny, cord-like structures about 2mm wide) grow from the base. These are flattened in *Armillaria mellea* and are distinctive enough to identify the genus. The mushrooms are also weakly bioluminescent - their gills glow very faintly in the dark.

Very common and widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, particularly in the south. More rare in northern regions. Grows parasitically on a large number of broadleaf trees, causing honey fungus root rot disease.

**Edibility Warning:**
The edibility is highly controversial. Cases of poisoning have been linked to eating these fungi, most probably because a small but significant proportion of people are adversely affected. Even when thoroughly cooked, this mushroom causes severe gastric distress in some people. Due to this, many sources recommend not collecting it for consumption at all.

If consumed, they MUST be cooked before eating. Always try only a small portion first to test for individual sensitivity. Never eat raw.

**Garden Pest:**
Honey Fungus is considered a serious pathogenic pest in gardens and forestry, causing root rot and death in trees and shrubs. The black rhizomorphs can spread through soil and attack healthy plants.

**Key Distinction:** Dense clustering habit, honey-yellow color, ring on stem, and especially the black bootlace rhizomorphs are diagnostic. The parasitic lifestyle on living trees also helps identify this species.
