**Identification:**
Larch Bolete is a medium-sized bolete found exclusively under larch trees (Larix). The cap is 5-12cm across, convex, colored bright golden-yellow to orange-yellow or rusty-brown. The surface is smooth and very slimy when wet. The pore surface is yellow, bruising brownish, with large angular pores.

The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, yellow above the ring, white to pale yellow below, often with rusty-brown glandular dots. **Diagnostic feature:** There is a ring on the stem - unusual for boletes. The ring is white to cream, membranous, often collapsing against the stem.

The flesh is pale yellow, soft, often waterlogged. Smell is faint or fruity. This bolete forms mycorrhizal associations exclusively with larch, making identification certain if the tree identification is correct.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly rated. The slimy cap skin should be removed. The flesh is soft and watery. Better for mixing with other mushrooms than eating alone. Young, firm specimens are best.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Slippery Jack** (Suillus luteus) - Under pine, darker brown cap
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - No ring, under pine, smaller pores
