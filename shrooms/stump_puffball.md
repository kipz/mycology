**Identification:**
Stump Puffball is a small pear-shaped puffball that grows in dense clusters on dead wood - this wood-inhabiting habitat immediately distinguishes it from most other puffballs. Each fruiting body is 2-4cm tall, 1.5-3cm wide, pear-shaped or top-shaped with a narrower base that has white root-like rhizomorphs (cords) attached.

The surface is pale brown to ochre, covered with small granules or warts when young, becoming smoother with age. **Critical edibility check:** When cut open, the interior must be pure white and homogeneous to be edible. Once it turns yellow or develops olive-brown spores, it's past edible stage.

When mature, the top develops a small opening through which spores puff out. The spores are olive-brown. Stump Puffballs grow in dense clusters on stumps, logs, and buried wood of deciduous trees.

**Culinary Value:** Edible when young and white inside, but small size and thin flesh make them less worthwhile than larger puffballs. Mild flavor. Can be sliced and fried. The clusters can provide a decent quantity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Puffball** (Lycoperdon perlatum) - On ground, not on wood, more spiny
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Thick skin, purple-black inside, not on wood

**Safety Rule:** Only eat when interior is pure white. The wood-growing habit is distinctive.
