**Identification:**
Black Trumpet, also known as Horn of Plenty or Trumpet of the Dead, is a highly prized edible mushroom despite its somewhat ominous common names. The fruiting body is 3-12cm tall, deeply funnel or trumpet-shaped with a hollow interior that extends all the way through to the base. The color ranges from dark grey-brown to almost black on the upper, inner surface, while the outer surface (which would be the underside) is grey and slightly wrinkled or veined rather than having true gills or pores.

The flesh is thin, elastic, and breaks cleanly when pulled. The margin is wavy and irregular. Black Trumpets grow scattered or in troops in mixed deciduous woodland, particularly with oak, beech, and hazel. They have a mycorrhizal relationship with these trees. **Challenge:** Despite being relatively common, they are extremely difficult to spot due to their dark color camouflaging perfectly against leaf litter and dark forest floors.

This mushroom is considered a gourmet delicacy with an intense, rich, smoky flavor. It dries exceptionally well and the flavor intensifies with drying - dried Black Trumpets can be crumbled into soups, stews, and sauces as a seasoning. Fresh specimens can be sautéed in butter. There are no poisonous lookalikes, making this a safe mushroom for beginners once you learn to spot it.

**Foraging Tips:**
- Look for them in the same spots year after year
- They often grow in the same location as chanterelles
- Easier to spot after rain when they darken further
- Check mossy areas and hollows
