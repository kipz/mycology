### Poison Pie
*Hebeloma crustuliniforme*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:poison_pie`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Causes gastrointestinal poisoning
- **Season:** Autumn to early winter (August-December)
- **Habitat:** Broadleaf woodlands, grassy areas, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** -1
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (0:25), Nausea II (0:30)

**Identification:**
The Poison Pie is a medium-sized mushroom with a cap 3-8cm across. The cap is off-white to pale tan, usually more brown towards the center, with a distinctly sticky or greasy feel, especially in damp conditions. The cap starts convex but develops a wide, prominent umbo (raised center) as it matures.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Smell:** Strong radish-like smell - this is the most diagnostic feature
- **Greasy cap:** Sticky or slimy surface when wet
- **Droplets on gills:** Dark droplets form on the gills in damp conditions; when dry, these leave brown spots/stains
- **Wide umbo:** Very prominent raised center to the cap

The gills start white, turning pale grey/brown with age but retaining a white edge. In damp conditions, they exude droplets of moisture. The stem is 3-10cm long, 1-2cm diameter, off-white, often with a slightly wider base, sometimes with remnants of a cortina (cobweb-like partial veil).

Common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, particularly in broadleaf woodlands. Often found in groups (sometimes in great numbers) under deciduous trees in woodlands, grassy areas, and parklands across the UK.

**Toxicity:**
This is a toxic toadstool and should definitely not be picked for eating. It's poisonous, causing mild to severe gastrointestinal upset, including vomiting, diarrhea, and colicky abdominal pain several hours after consumption. While not usually fatal, the illness can be unpleasant and prolonged.

**Why "Poison Pie"?**
The common name comes from the pale tan color and shape of young specimens which can resemble a small pie, combined with its poisonous nature. The name serves as an appropriate warning.

**Key Identifying Feature:**
The strong radish-like smell is the best diagnostic feature. If you smell a mushroom with a radish odor, a greasy cap, wide umbo, and droplets/stains on the gills, it's likely a Poison Pie or related *Hebeloma* species - none of which should be eaten.

**Similar Species:**
- Various other *Hebeloma* species look similar - all should be avoided
- Can be confused with edible *Tricholoma* species, but the radish smell distinguishes it

**Key Distinction:** The combination of radish smell, greasy cap, wide umbo, and dark droplets or brown stains on the gills make this species distinctive. The smell is the most reliable feature - memorize it.

**Safety Note:** All *Hebeloma* species should be considered poisonous or suspect. Learn to recognize the genus and avoid it entirely.
