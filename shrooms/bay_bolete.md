**Identification:**
Bay Bolete is a highly regarded edible bolete with a distinctive bay-brown to chestnut-brown cap that gives it its common name. The cap is 5-15cm across, hemispherical when young, expanding to convex or flat. The surface is smooth to slightly velvety and can be sticky when wet. The pore surface underneath is pale yellow when young, becoming greenish-yellow with age, and characteristically bruises blue-green when touched or damaged.

The stem is 5-12cm tall and 1-3cm thick, cylindrical or slightly club-shaped, colored similarly to the cap or paler. The flesh is pale yellowish-white, firm in young specimens, turning slightly blue when cut (though less dramatically than many other boletes). It has a pleasant mild smell and taste. Bay Bolete forms mycorrhizal associations with conifers, particularly Scots pine, but can also be found with beech and oak in mixed woodland.

This is considered an excellent edible mushroom, with firm flesh and good flavor. **Important:** Like all wild mushrooms, it must be cooked thoroughly for at least 15 minutes before eating - never consume raw. The tubes should be removed from older specimens as they become slimy when cooked. Young, firm specimens are best for eating.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Porcini/Cep** (Boletus edulis) - Paler cap, white reticulation on stem
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - Smaller, more yellow-brown, less blue bruising
