**Identification:**
The Wood Blewit (also known simply as Blewit) is a striking mushroom with vibrant purple coloration when young. The cap is 4-15cm across, initially convex becoming flatter with age, and often with an inrolled margin. When young, the entire mushroom - cap, gills, and stem - displays beautiful violet coloring. As it matures, the cap surface loses color from the center outward, turning ochre or tan, though the gills and stem retain violaceous tones.

**Critical feature:** The distinctive fruity odor likened to frozen orange juice or parfait, combined with the purple coloration (especially in younger specimens). The gills are crowded, sinuate (notched near the stem), and retain purple coloring longer than the cap. The stem is 4-10cm tall, fibrous, swollen at the base, and colored similar to the gills. The spore print is white to pale pink. The flesh is thick, pale lilac, and firm.

The Blewit grows in leaf litter in woodland, particularly under deciduous trees, but also commonly appears in gardens, compost heaps, and wood chip mulch. It often fruits in rings or troops and can produce impressive flushes in favorable conditions.

**Culinary Value:** Wood Blewits are highly regarded edible mushrooms with a rich, slightly fruity flavor and firm texture. They are particularly popular in France, Spain, and Portugal, where they're sold in supermarkets throughout autumn and winter. The mushrooms have a sweet, perfumed aroma that carries through to their taste. They are excellent sautéed and served with pale meats (veal, pork, chicken) and work well in cheese, rice, and pasta dishes. They can also be pickled or preserved.

**IMPORTANT:** Must be thoroughly cooked - never eat raw. Even when cooked, it's advisable to try a small portion first, as they can disagree with some people. Some individuals experience gastrointestinal upset.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Cortinarius violaceus** (Violet Webcap) - EDIBLE but rare. Web-like veil, rust-brown spores
- **Cortinarius species** - Some POISONOUS. Have rusty-brown spore prints (Blewits are pale pink/white)
- **Mycena pura** (Lilac Bonnet) - POISONOUS. Much smaller, thin-fleshed, radish smell

**Key Distinction:** The fruity "frozen orange juice" smell, substantial firm flesh, pale spore print, and purple coloration (especially gills and stem) are diagnostic. Always check spore print - it must be pale pink or white, NOT rust-brown.
