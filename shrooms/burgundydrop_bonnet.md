**Identification:**
The Burgundydrop Bonnet, also called Bleeding Fairy Helmet or Bleeding Mycena, is highly distinctive for its remarkable ability to exude dark red droplets when cut or damaged. The cap is 2-4cm across at maturity, initially conical becoming bell-shaped with a slight umbo (central bump). The surface is silky smooth and striate almost to the center when moist. The cap is usually pinkish-brown or reddish-brown, drying to pale greyish-pink, with distinctive scalloped edges.

**Critical feature:** The dark red latex (burgundy-colored "blood") that oozes from damaged tissue gives this mushroom its common name. When the stem or gills are broken or cut, dark red droplets appear. The gills are whitish, adnexed (narrowly attached to stem), and edges often develop reddish coloration. The stem is thin, fragile, reddish-brown, and covered with thick coarse hairs at the base. The flesh has a radish-like smell and bitter, mild taste.

This species is saprobic, growing on trunks, stumps, and fallen wood of deciduous broadleaf trees, particularly oaks, in well-shaded and damp locations. It typically grows in small groups.

**Edibility Status:** Although some sources claim M. haematopus is technically edible, it is universally disregarded for consumption. The mushroom is insubstantial (too small and thin-fleshed), tastes bitter, and related Mycena species can be toxic. Most sources recommend avoiding consumption entirely due to potential toxicity of related taxa and the mushroom's unpleasant taste.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Other Mycena species** - Many small Mycena species exist. The bleeding red latex is diagnostic for M. haematopus
- **Mycena sanguinolenta** - Also bleeds red but much smaller, grows on ground litter rather than wood
- **Non-bleeding Mycena species** - Can look similar but won't produce red droplets when damaged

**Key Distinction:** The dark red latex that appears when the mushroom is cut or damaged is unique and unmistakable. No other common British woodland mushroom on dead wood produces this burgundy-colored "blood." Despite being non-toxic, it should not be eaten due to its bitter taste and insubstantial nature.
