**Identification:**
Lion's Mane is one of the most distinctive and unmistakable fungi. The fruiting body is 10-40cm across, forming a large, white, shaggy mass of long, cascading spines that truly resemble a lion's mane or a white pom-pom. The spines are 1-5cm long, soft, white when fresh, becoming yellowish with age. The entire fungus grows from a tough, branched base attached to the tree.

This fungus grows on dead or dying hardwood trees, particularly beech and oak, usually high up on trunks or large branches. It's relatively rare in the UK, making it a special find. The species is a white rot fungus causing decay of heartwood.

**Culinary Value:** Highly prized gourmet mushroom with exceptional flavor and texture. The taste is often compared to seafood - lobster or crab-like. Excellent sautéed in butter, breaded and fried, or in soups. The texture is meaty and slightly chewy. Young, fresh, white specimens are best. As it ages and yellows, it becomes bitter.

**Medicinal Interest:** Subject of research for potential neurological benefits, including nerve growth factor stimulation. Traditional use in Chinese medicine.

**Lookalikes:**
None - the cascading white spines are unique and unmistakable.

**Conservation Note:** Relatively uncommon in UK. Harvest sustainably and never take all fruiting bodies.
