*Inocybe geophylla*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:common_white_inocybe`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Contains muscarine - VERY TOXIC
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (June-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed and deciduous woodlands

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** -2
- **Saturation:** 0.0

**Identification:**
The Common White Inocybe is a small to medium-sized poisonous mushroom with a cap 2-5cm in diameter. The cap is white to cream-colored with a silky, fibrous texture, initially conical to bell-shaped, becoming flatter with age while usually retaining a pointed umbo. The surface has a distinctive radial fibrous pattern that tends to split along the margins as it matures.

The stem is 3-7cm tall, white, often with a slightly bulbous base. The gills are cream-colored when young, darkening to clay-brown with age. **Critical safety feature:** The mushroom has a distinctive earthy or spermatic odor - often described as smelling like damp flour or raw potatoes.

The Common White Inocybe forms mycorrhizal associations with various deciduous trees, particularly beech, oak, and birch. It can occasionally be found near conifers. The mushroom grows in soil from summer through autumn.

**Toxicity:**
This mushroom is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and contains potentially lethal amounts of muscarine. Symptoms of muscarine poisoning include greatly increased salivation, sweating, and tear flow within 15-30 minutes of ingestion. With large doses, these may be followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, diarrhea, blurred vision, and labored breathing. Those with heart or respiratory problems are at greatest risk.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Lilac Fibrecap** (*Inocybe geophylla* var. *lilacina*) - Also POISONOUS. Lilac-colored variety of the same species
- **St George's Mushroom** (*Calocybe gambosa*) - EDIBLE. Larger, more robust, mealy smell, no pointed umbo
- **Fairy Ring Champignon** (*Marasmius oreades*) - EDIBLE. Much smaller, tougher, grows in rings

**Key Distinction:** ALL members of the *Inocybe* genus should be avoided. The distinctive earthy/spermatic smell, silky white cap with pointed umbo, and habitat in woodlands are key identification features. Never consume any white woodland mushroom without expert identification.
