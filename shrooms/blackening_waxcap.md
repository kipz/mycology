**Identification:**
Blackening Waxcap is a striking grassland mushroom with a distinctive and diagnostic characteristic - it turns black when damaged or with age. The cap is 2-6cm across, conical to bell-shaped, rarely expanding flat. When fresh, it's brightly colored in shades of yellow, orange, or red - often a brilliant scarlet-red. The surface is smooth and greasy (waxy), giving the waxcap group their name. The gills are yellow to orange, free from the stem, and relatively thick and widely spaced.

The stem is 4-9cm tall, cylindrical, hollow, colored yellow-orange, and often twisted. **Diagnostic feature:** All parts of the mushroom turn jet black when bruised, handled, or with age. This blackening reaction happens within minutes to hours and is unmistakable. The flesh is thin, yellowish, and fragile, with no distinctive smell but a slightly unpleasant taste.

This species grows in unimproved grassland, lawns, and parks - habitats that haven't been heavily fertilized. It's an indicator species for high-quality grassland fungal communities. While not seriously poisonous, it causes gastric upset and is considered inedible. Some sources suggest it may be mildly toxic. The blackening feature makes it easy to identify and avoid.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other brightly colored waxcaps - None turn black when damaged
- **Scarlet Waxcap** (Hygrocybe coccinea) - Scarlet red, does NOT blacken

**Warning:** While most waxcaps are edible, this one is an exception. Never eat mushrooms that blacken dramatically.
