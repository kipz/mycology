**Identification:**
Coral Spot is not actually a mushroom but a distinctive ascomycete fungus that forms tiny, bright coral-pink to orange-red pustules on dead wood. When young, these structures appear as minuscule pink blobs (around the size of a pinhead) that are soft and spongy. As they mature, they harden and change to a reddish-brown color, eventually becoming dark red. The pustules are usually 1-4mm in length.

The fungus has two distinct stages: During spring or early summer, coral pink or light purplish-red spore-producing structures form (sexual stage), which age to tan or brown. In summer and autumn, orange-red fruiting structures are produced that eventually mature to dark red and can survive through winter (asexual stage with spongy conidia).

Coral Spot is extremely common throughout Britain and Ireland and temperate regions worldwide. It grows as a saprophyte on dead wood from broadleaf trees, particularly common on Beech, Sycamore, Horse Chestnut, and Hornbeam. The tiny bright spots are easily visible against the dark bark.

**Ecological Role:**
Nectria cinnabarina is primarily a saprophytic fungus (feeding on dead wood), but will act as a weak pathogen if presented with an opportunity via wounds in the tree or other stressors that weaken the tree's defense. It causes cankers and dieback in stressed trees but is typically harmless to healthy specimens.

**Distinctive Features:**
The bright coral-pink to orange-red color and tiny pustule-like appearance make this fungus unmistakable. Unlike most fungi in this guide, it's not a mushroom with a cap and stem but rather forms small bumps directly on the wood surface. Often appears in large numbers scattered across dead branches.

**Similar Species:**
Difficult to confuse with anything else due to its distinctive bright color and small pustule form on dead wood.
