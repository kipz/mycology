**Identification:**
Clouded Funnel is a large, robust mushroom that grows in impressive troops or fairy rings in woodland, particularly around the edges of clearings. The cap is 8-20cm across (occasionally larger), convex when young, soon becoming flat and then shallowly funnel-shaped with a wavy margin. The color is grey-brown, grey, or buff-grey - the common name "clouded" refers to this cloudy grey appearance and the somewhat zoned, cloud-like surface. The surface is smooth, matt, and dry.

The gills are crowded, decurrent (running down the stem), white to cream, and sometimes develop yellow-brown spots with age. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 2-3cm thick, robust, swollen at the base, and colored like the cap. The flesh is thick, white, and firm with a **very strong, distinctive smell** that is sweet, fruity, and somewhat sickly or perfumed - some describe it as similar to tomcat urine or artificial fruit flavoring. This strong smell is diagnostic.

**Edibility Concerns:** Clouded Funnel is listed as edible in older books but causes gastric upset in a significant number of people, even when properly cooked. Some individuals can eat it with no problems, while others experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The reaction may be allergic or due to individual sensitivity. For this reason, it's considered "edible with caution" and is best avoided. If trying it, eat only a small amount when first testing.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Ivory Funnel** (Clitocybe dealbata) - DEADLY. Much smaller, white, no strong smell, in grassland
- **Fool's Funnel** (C. rivulosa) - DEADLY. Smaller, whiter, grassland species
- Other large Clitocybe species - Generally distinguish by smell and habitat

**WARNING:** Due to individual sensitivity and risk of confusion with deadly grassland Clitocybe species, this mushroom is best avoided.
