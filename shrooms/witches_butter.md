**Identification:**
Witches Butter, also called Yellow Brain Fungus, is a distinctive jelly fungus that looks like an orange gelatinous blob. The fruiting bodies form irregular, brain-like masses that are smooth and lobed, with a tough, greasy, or slimy texture when wet. The color ranges from pale yellow to bright orange when fresh, becoming rusty orange when dry.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Gelatinous/jelly-like texture:** The fungus is slippery and rubbery when wet
- **Bright yellow-orange color:** Very vibrant when fresh and wet
- **Lobed structure:** Forms convoluted, brain-like folds
- **Hardens when dry:** Becomes hard and shriveled in dry conditions, rehydrating after rain

The fruiting bodies can range from 1-8cm across. When dry, they shrink to hard, dark orange crusts but rehydrate with rain, regaining their gelatinous texture and bright color.

Found throughout the UK and Ireland, growing on dead and decaying hardwood, especially oak and beech. Thrives in damp, shaded areas of woodlands across the UK, often appearing after heavy rain. Most visible from autumn through winter but can appear year-round.

**Parasitic Nature:**
Yellow Brain is a parasitic fungus that feeds on wood-rotting fungi of the *Peniophora* genus. One of the most common hosts in the UK is the Rosy Crust fungus (*Peniophora incarnata*). It's a mycoparasite - a fungus that parasitizes other fungi.

**Edibility:**
There is debate about the edibility of this fungus. Although some sources categorize it as inedible or merely "non-poisonous," others say it is edible but flavorless. It's often described as having so little substance and being flavorless. However, in China, *Tremella* species are used to give a signature texture to soups. The consensus is that *T. mesenterica* is non-poisonous but offers little culinary value.

**Similar Species:**
- **Leafy Brain** (*Tremella foliacea*) - Brown and more lobed
- **Golden Ear** (*Tremella aurantia*) - Similar but found on dead oaks and beech, more cup-shaped

**Key Distinction:** The bright yellow-orange gelatinous blobs on dead wood are unmistakable. The combination of the vibrant color, jelly-like texture, and ability to shrivel when dry and rehydrate when wet make this fungus unique.

**Also Known As:** Yellow Brain Fungus
