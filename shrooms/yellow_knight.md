**Identification:**
The Yellow Knight, also known as Man on Horseback, is a medium to large mushroom with a cap 5-12cm across. The cap is golden-yellow to greenish-yellow with fine brown scales or fibres, particularly towards the center. The cap is initially convex, becoming flatter with age, often with a slight umbo.

The gills are bright yellow, crowded, sinuate (notched where they meet the stem), and do not change color. The stem is 4-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, yellow, solid, often with a slightly bulbous base. The flesh is white to pale yellow with a mild smell and taste.

**Critical identifying feature:** The entire mushroom is predominantly yellow (cap, gills, stem), with brown scales/fibres only on the cap center. The stem lacks a ring.

Forms ectomycorrhizal associations with pine trees. Found in pine forests, often on sandy soils. Widespread but not common throughout Britain and Ireland and other temperate regions.

**Toxicity - Important Safety Warning:**
The edibility of this mushroom is HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL and it is now considered TOXIC by many authorities:

**Historical Status:** For a long time, this species was highly regarded as one of the tastier edible mushrooms and was sold in European markets.

**2001 - Concerns Raised:** Rhabdomyolysis (a serious condition causing muscle breakdown) was first reported in 2001, with 12 poisoning cases, three with fatal outcomes believed to be associated with consuming this mushroom.

**Current Status:** Some countries officially registered *T. equestre* as a poisonous species. However, the evidence remains debated, with some studies suggesting the mushroom cannot be conclusively proven toxic. A 2020 systematic review recommends "not to harvest and consume this species."

**UK Status:** In the UK, they are now thought to be toxic, although there is debate. Given the potential for serious harm or death, consumption is NOT recommended.

**Symptoms of Poisoning:**
Rhabdomyolysis symptoms can include muscle pain, weakness, dark urine, and in severe cases, kidney failure. Onset can occur after multiple meals over several days.

**Similar Species:**
- **Sulphur Knight** (*Tricholoma sulphureum*) - Also yellow, smells strongly of sulphur/coal tar, NOT edible
- Other *Tricholoma* species can be confused

**Key Distinction:** The overall yellow coloration (cap, gills, stem) with brown fibres only on cap center, growth under pines, and lack of strong smell distinguish this species. The Sulphur Knight has a distinct chemical/sulphur smell.

**SAFETY RECOMMENDATION:** Given the controversy and reported fatalities, DO NOT consume this mushroom. The potential risk far outweighs any culinary value.
