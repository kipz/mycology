**Identification:**
The Willow Bracket is a perennial bracket fungus that forms woody-hard, hoof or disc-shaped brackets rising from the bark of infested trees. The fruiting bodies measure 5-20cm in diameter, but in rare cases may reach 40cm wide. They can persist for many years, building a new surface layer each year.

**Upper Surface:** Often dark brown to black, with a smooth texture and sometimes a velvety appearance when fresh. The surface is covered with a dark, often cracked crust. The edges may be lighter in color, particularly on actively growing margins.

**Underside/Pore Surface:** Features small pores rather than gills, which is characteristic of polypores. The pore surface is usually yellowish to light brown, with pores about 4-6 per square millimeter.

**Texture:** Unlike most fungi, it has a hard woody consistency - almost like touching wood itself. The flesh is rust-brown to cinnamon-brown, very tough and corky.

The species has only a minimal stem in its infancy, becoming entirely sessile (stemless) as it matures. The fruiting bodies are perennial and may persist for many years, with each growth season adding a new layer.

**Host Trees:** The tree species is often willow (hence the common name), but it's commonly found on birch and alder as well, along with other broadleaf trees. The fungus grows on dead or dying trees and causes white rot, degrading lignin and cellulose in the wood.

**Ecological Role:**
This fungus lives by saprophytic nutrition, degrading lignin and cellulose in host trees and causing white rot. While damaging to the tree, it plays an important ecological role in forest decomposition and nutrient cycling.

**Historical and Medicinal Uses:**
Despite being inedible due to its woody texture, this fungus has been historically used in traditional medicine and has been studied for potential health benefits.

**Similar Species:**
- Other *Phellinus* species and large woody brackets can look similar
- **Hoof Fungus** (*Fomes fomentarius*) - Similar hoof shape but has different pore structure and cinnamon flesh

**Key Distinction:** The combination of hoof or disc shape, very hard woody texture, dark upper surface, yellowish-brown pore surface, and growth on willows and related trees are characteristic. The perennial nature and annual growth layers visible in cross-section help identification.

**Note:** The fungus is considered inedible, being woodlike in consistency.
