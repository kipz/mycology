*Neoboletus luridiformis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:scarletina_bolete`
- **Edibility:** Edible (MUST be well cooked!)
- **Toxicity:** Toxic if raw or undercooked
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous woodland and pine forests, often with bilberries

**In-Game Properties:**

**Identification:**
The Scarletina Bolete is a large, colorful bolete that's also known as the Dotted Stem Bolete. The cap is 7-11cm across (sometimes larger), starting bay to brown and velvety when young, soon becoming smooth. The edge of the cap is usually lighter in color.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Red dotted stem:** The stem is 7-11cm long, 2-4.5cm diameter, yellow with a dense covering of red dots that tends to discolor to dark blue/black when touched. **CRITICALLY**, the stem has NO network pattern (reticulation) - only dots
- **Immediate blue bruising:** When damaged, the flesh turns blue very quickly
- **Orange-red pores:** Has sponge-like pores starting yellow-orange, becoming red-brown, sometimes staying lighter around the edge

The pores bruise easily and stain dark blue to black. The flesh is yellow and turns blue immediately when cut - this color change is rapid and dramatic.

Fairly common in deciduous woodland and pine forests in Britain and Ireland, often found among bilberries. Common across most of the UK, more often on acidic soils.

**Culinary Value:**
This mushroom is a great edible if well cooked, rated 4/5 for edibility - firm and flavoursome, almost as good as a cep, and less likely to be maggoty. However, it can cause vomiting and diarrhea if not cooked properly. It should ALWAYS be well cooked as it's mildly toxic raw. Some literature recommends cooking for 20 minutes; when raw or insufficiently cooked it can cause gastroenteritis.

**Safety Warning:**
Great caution should be taken in distinguishing this from toxic boletes. This mushroom is easily confused with poisonous species such as Devil's Bolete (*Rubroboletus satanas*). NOT recommended for novice foragers.

**Dangerous Lookalikes:**
- **Devil's Bolete** (*Rubroboletus satanas*) - VERY POISONOUS. Pale lumpy cap, red pores, RED MESH on stem
- **Lurid Bolete** (*Suillellus luridus*) - Edible cooked. Red MESH on stem (not dots)

**Key Distinction:** The combination of red DOTS (not a network) on the yellow stem, immediate blue bruising, and orange-red pores are diagnostic. The Lurid Bolete and Devil's Bolete both have a red mesh/network on the stem, unlike the Scarletina's red dots.

**Also Known As:** Dotted Stem Bolete, Red Foot Bolete
