**Identification:**
The Deceiver earns its name from its highly variable appearance depending on moisture conditions - it "deceives" by looking like many different mushrooms at different times. The cap is 2-6cm across, convex to flat, often with a depressed center and wavy margin. **The color is highly hygrophanous**: when moist, it's orange-brown, pinkish-brown to reddish-brown; when dry, it fades to pale buff, cream, or pinkish-white. This dramatic color change is characteristic.

The gills are thick, widely spaced, broadly attached to slightly decurrent, colored similarly to the cap. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 3-8mm thick, tough and fibrous, colored like the cap, often longitudinally fibrous and twisted. The base is covered with white mycelial threads. The flesh is thin, colored like the cap, with no distinctive smell or taste.

Deceiver is extremely common and widespread, forming mycorrhizal associations with various trees in deciduous and coniferous woodland, heathland, and parks. It can appear in large troops. **The combination of variable color, widely spaced thick gills, tough fibrous stem, and white basal mycelium helps identification.**

**Edibility:** While edible, the Deceiver is not highly rated due to its thin flesh and tough, fibrous texture. Some people enjoy the mild, slightly nutty flavor. It can be fried or added to soups and stews. Must be cooked thoroughly. The stem is too tough and should be discarded. Not worth seeking out, but can be used if found in quantity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Amethyst Deceiver** (Laccaria amethystina) - Purple when fresh, otherwise similar
- Various small brown mushrooms - Check for thick, widely spaced gills and fibrous stem
