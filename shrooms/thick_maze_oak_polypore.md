**Identification:**
The Thick-Walled Maze Polypore, also known as Oak Mazegill, forms substantial sessile (stemless), fan-shaped fruiting bodies typically 3-20cm wide and up to 8cm thick. The brackets are found singly or in tiered groups, usually on rotting oak.

**Upper Surface:** Cream, beige to ochre, velvety at first, then becoming uneven with small, hard warts. The top is a buff to orangish-brown color.

**Critical identifying feature - Maze-like pores:** The undersurface is white to tan in color, initially porous, but as the fruit body matures, some of the pore walls break down, forming slits with blunt partitions. This results in the characteristic maze-like or labyrinthine pattern. The pores are wide, irregular, and appear to radiate out from where the bracket attaches to the wood - this maze pattern is diagnostic.

The flesh is tough, pale buff to tan, making a clean cut with a knife with relative ease, as if cutting rubber. The texture is woody but flexible when fresh.

The specific epithet "*quercina*" refers to the oak genus *Quercus*, upon which it frequently grows. Saprophytic, appearing on dead stumps and fallen branches primarily of Oak and sometimes Sweet Chestnut, causing a brown rot.

**UK Distribution:** Has been reported from nearly all European countries, following the pattern of oak distribution. The bracket can be seen all year round but releases spores in late summer and autumn.

**Historical Uses:**
Despite being inedible, this fungus has historical uses. The tough flesh was sometimes used as a strop for sharpening razors, giving it the alternate name "razor strop fungus."

**Similar Species:**
- **Blushing Bracket** (*Daedaleopsis confragosa*) - Bruises pinkish/reddish, different pore structure
- Other maze-gill polypores

**Key Distinction:** The maze-like pore structure on the undersurface, association with oak wood, and very thick, tough, corky flesh make this species distinctive. The tough texture and maze pattern are unmistakable once you've seen it. Can be cut with a knife but is far too tough to be edible.

**Ecological Role:**
This fungus plays an important role in forest ecology by decomposing dead oak wood, causing brown rot that breaks down cellulose and helps recycle nutrients.
