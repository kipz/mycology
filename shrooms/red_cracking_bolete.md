### Red Cracking Bolete
*Xerocomellus chrysenteron*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:red_cracking_bolete`
- **Edibility:** Edible but poor quality
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Early summer to mid-winter (June-December)
- **Habitat:** Hardwood and conifer woods on well-drained soils

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Red Cracking Bolete is a small to medium bolete with a cap 4-10cm in diameter. The cap is a dull smooth brown when young, then develops characteristic cracks showing pale yellow/buff underneath with hints of red - this cracking pattern is the key identifying feature and gives the mushroom its name.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Cracked cap:** Shows pale flesh beneath with red staining in the cracks
- **Angular yellow pores:** On the undersurface, bruising greenish
- **Red fibrillose stem:** Lower stem is bright yellow with coral-red fibrils
- **Blue bruising:** Flesh turns blue when cut or bruised

The stem is 4-9cm tall, 1-2cm diameter, with no ring. It's mostly bright yellow, particularly at the top, with the lower portion covered in coral-red fibrous patterns. The flesh is thin and pale yellow, turning blue when cut or slightly damaged.

The pores are angular and yellow, sometimes greening slightly with age, bruising greenish or blue-green. The tubes are yellow.

This mushroom grows singly or in small groups in hardwood/conifer woods on well-drained soils from early summer to mid-winter. It's mycorrhizal with hardwood trees, often beech. Distribution in Britain and Ireland is probably infrequent, though historic records may be unreliable due to confusion with closely related species.

**Culinary Value:**
*Xerocomellus chrysenteron* is generally considered edible if cooked thoroughly; however, because of its soggy texture this bolete is not highly regarded as food. It's often described as bland in flavor with a soft, slimy texture when cooked. **Tip:** Remove the pores immediately after picking as they rapidly decay. The texture can be improved by removing pores, then either frying hard or drying, rehydrating, and cooking.

**Important Note:**
*Xerocomellus chrysenteron* cannot be identified with certainty without microscopy, as many intermediate forms occur between it and other closely related species in the complex.

**Similar Species:**
- Various *Xerocomellus* species are very similar and may require microscopy
- Other brown-capped boletes with yellow pores

**Key Distinction:** The combination of cracked cap showing red-tinged yellow flesh beneath, yellow pores, coral-red fibrils on lower stem, and blue bruising are characteristic. However, several closely related species are nearly identical macroscopically.
