**Identification:**
Bitter Oysterling is a small, tough bracket or fan-shaped mushroom that grows in dense overlapping clusters on dead hardwood stumps and branches. Each cap is 1-4cm across, kidney to shell-shaped, with a lateral attachment. The upper surface is pale brown to cinnamon-brown, finely hairy to velvety, often with a zoned or wrinkled texture. The gills are closely spaced, pale buff to cinnamon, running down to the point of attachment.

The stem, when present, is very short and lateral. The flesh is thin, tough, and leathery. **Critical feature:** The taste is intensely bitter (though never swallow when testing - spit out immediately). This extreme bitterness makes it completely inedible and causes the common name. Interestingly, some North American populations of this fungus are bioluminescent - the gills glow green in the dark - though UK specimens rarely show this feature.

This fungus fruits year-round but is most abundant in autumn and winter. It plays an ecological role as a decomposer of hardwood, particularly oak and beech. While not seriously toxic, the bitter compounds can cause gastric upset if eaten, and the tough texture would make it unpalatable regardless.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Oyster Mushroom** (Pleurotus ostreatus) - Much larger, soft flesh, mild taste, grows in different seasons
- Other small Pleurotus species - Soft, edible, not bitter

**Warning:** Always taste-test suspect oyster mushrooms (spit out) - the intense bitterness instantly distinguishes this inedible species.
