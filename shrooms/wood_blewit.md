**Identification:**
Wood Blewit is a distinctive mushroom colored in shades of blue-lilac when young. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flat, often wavy-margined. The color is lilac-blue to purple-blue when young and fresh, fading to buff-brown with age (but usually retaining some lilac tones). The surface is smooth, matt, slightly greasy when wet.

The gills are lilac to purple-pink, crowded, sinuate (notched), developing rusty spots with age. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1.5-3cm thick, stout, colored like the cap or paler lilac, often with a slightly bulbous base. The flesh is thick, firm, lilac-tinged, with a distinctive sweet, fruity, slightly perfumed smell.

Wood Blewit grows in woodland, woodland edges, gardens, and parks, often on compost or mulch. It fruits in troops or rings in late autumn and early winter, often persisting after frosts.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible with firm texture and distinctive flavor. The flavor is rich and slightly perfumed. Excellent in risottos, pasta dishes, or sautéed. The stems are good to eat (unlike many species). **MUST be cooked thoroughly** - causes gastric upset if eaten raw or undercooked.

**Edibility Concerns:** Some people experience reactions even when cooked. Try small amounts first. Never eat raw.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Lilac Webcap** (Cortinarius traganus) - INEDIBLE. Rusty-brown spores (not pink-buff), unpleasant smell
- **Violet Webcap** (Cortinarius violaceus) - Unknown edibility. Darker violet, rusty spores
- **Wood Woolly-foot** (Collybia peronata) - Different structure, woodland

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** The combination of lilac color, pink-buff spores, and fruity smell confirms Wood Blewit. Take a spore print to confirm pale pink-buff color (not rusty-brown).
