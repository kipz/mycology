**Identification:**
Fairies Bonnet, also known as the Fairy Inkcap, is a delicate mushroom that grows in dense troops - often hundreds appearing together like a fairy army. The tiny caps are 0.5-2cm in diameter, conic to campanulate (bell-shaped), with colors ranging from yellow-brown to grey-brown. The cap surface is striate or has pleats over the margin, giving it a delicate ribbed appearance.

The gills are adnate or free, distant, narrow, white when young, turning grey to black with age. Unlike most inkcaps, the gills do not deliquesce (liquefy) to the same extent as other Coprinellus species - they don't turn into an inky mess. The stem is 2-4cm long, 0.1-0.2cm thick, equal, often curved, with a smooth to slightly scurfy surface. The stem is white and hollow. The spore print is black.

These gregarious fungi form dense masses swarming over rotting tree stumps, buried wood, and roots, occurring from early spring until the onset of winter. They appear almost overnight following rain and can cover entire tree stumps in spectacular displays. Common and widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, also found throughout Europe, North America, Asia, South America, and Australia.

**Culinary Value:**
The Fairy Inkcap is reported to be edible and not toxic, but due to its small size and insubstantial nature, collecting a sufficient quantity for a meal is viewed as more effort than it's worth. The mushrooms are so small and delicate that they contribute little substance to a dish.

**Distinctive Features:**
The sheer number of tiny mushrooms appearing together in dense troops is the most striking feature. When you find one Fairies Bonnet, you'll typically find hundreds growing together on the same piece of wood.

**Similar Species:**
- Other small Coprinellus species can look similar, but the non-deliquescing nature and extreme gregariousness make this species distinct

**Key Distinction:** Growing in enormous troops on wood, tiny size, and gills that stay relatively intact (don't melt into ink) distinguish this from other inkcaps.
