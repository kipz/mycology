**Identification:**
The Aniseed Funnel is highly distinctive due to its blue-green coloration and strong aniseed aroma. The cap is 2-11cm across, starting convex then flattening or becoming vase-shaped with age. The distinctive blue-green or greenish color fades quickly to paler cream or whitish, especially in dry weather or older specimens. The gills are white to cream, decurrent (running down the stem), and crowded.

**Critical feature:** The overwhelming smell of aniseed or liquorice is one of the most distinctive identification features in British fungi. This odor is due to p-anisaldehyde and benzaldehyde compounds. The stem is 3-8cm tall, smooth, colored similar to the cap, and slightly swollen at the base. The flesh is pale, watery, and maintains the strong aniseed scent even when dried.

The species grows in small groups near tree roots, forming mycorrhizal associations with both deciduous and coniferous trees. It fruits from August through December.

**Culinary Value:** While edible, the Aniseed Funnel is best used dried as a flavoring agent rather than as a fresh mushroom. The intense aniseed flavor can be overpowering if used fresh. When dried and used sparingly, it adds an interesting liquorice-like note to soups, stews, and risottos. Some foragers enjoy it fried with onions, but use moderation due to the strong flavor.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Stropharia aeruginosa** (Verdigris Agaric) - POISONOUS. Young specimens can be confused. Has a slimy cap, ring on stem, purple-brown spore print
- **Clitocybe fragrans** - SUSPECT/AVOID. Pale specimens can be confused with this species. Similar smell but paler overall
- **Other toxic Clitocybe species** - Several poisonous white Clitocybe species exist. Always verify the blue-green color and aniseed smell

**Key Distinction:** Only collect fresh specimens showing the blue-green coloration. The unmistakable aniseed smell combined with blue-green cap is diagnostic. Avoid pale or faded specimens that could be confused with toxic species.
