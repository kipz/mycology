**Identification:**
Birch Polypore is a distinctive bracket fungus found exclusively on birch trees (Betula species), making it one of the easiest fungi to identify with certainty. The fruiting body is 5-30cm across, kidney or hoof-shaped, with a smooth, rounded upper surface that is pale brown to gray-brown, sometimes with a slight bloom. The underside is white to cream with tiny round pores (4-5 per mm). Young specimens have a rounded, bulbous appearance, becoming more bracket-like with age.

The flesh is white, corky when fresh, becoming very hard and brittle when dried. The fungus is annual or short-lived perennial. A key feature is the distinct separation layer between the cap and stem - the cap can often be easily removed from the tree, leaving the stem attached. This fungus is a white rot species that accelerates the decay of dead birch wood.

Historically, Birch Polypore has been used for medicinal purposes - it was found with Ötzi the Iceman, suggesting use dating back at least 5,300 years. Modern research has shown it contains compounds with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiparasitic properties. Traditionally, it was used to sharpen razors (hence the alternative name "Razor Strop Fungus") and to treat stomach ailments.

**Medicinal Uses:**
- Made into tea for digestive issues
- Anti-inflammatory properties

**Lookalikes:**
