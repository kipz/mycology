*Cortinarius rubellus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:deadly_webcap`
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0

- **Effects:** Wither I (1200 ticks), Poison II (1200 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Webcap contains orellanine, a toxin that causes irreversible kidney failure. The delayed onset of symptoms (2-21 days) means victims often don't connect illness to mushroom consumption until severe damage is done. Multiple fatalities recorded.**

Deadly Webcap is a medium-sized Cortinarius species. The cap is 3-8cm across, conical to bell-shaped, expanding to convex with a distinct umbo. The surface is finely fibrous to scaly, colored orange-brown to cinnamon-brown or reddish-brown. The gills are initially cinnamon-orange, becoming more rust-brown with age, adnate to slightly decurrent.

The stem is 5-12cm tall, 0.5-1.5cm thick, cylindrical, colored orange-brown to yellow-brown with darker reddish-brown fibrous bands or girdles (zones). When young, there is a cobweb-like cortina (veil) connecting cap margin to stem - this leaves rusty remnants on the stem. The flesh is yellowish to orange-brown with no distinctive smell.

This species grows in coniferous woodland, particularly with pine and spruce, in upland areas. It's found in Scotland and northern England. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms, including chanterelles by inexperienced foragers, with fatal consequences.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains orellanine, a bipyridine compound that causes **delayed and progressive kidney failure**:
- **Latency period:** 2-21 days (commonly 3-14 days) before symptoms appear
- Initial symptoms: Intense thirst, dry mouth, headache, fatigue
- Progresses to kidney pain, decreased urination
- Leads to acute kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant
- **NO ANTIDOTE** - treatment is supportive only
- Mortality rate is significant; survivors often require lifelong dialysis

The long delay means victims may not associate symptoms with mushroom consumption, delaying treatment. Even small amounts can cause irreversible damage.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Fool's Webcap** (Cortinarius orellanus) - EQUALLY DEADLY, similar toxins, more orange
- **Chanterelle** (Cantharellus cibarius) - EDIBLE but completely different structure: false gills (ridges), funnel-shaped
- Other Cortinarius species - Many are unknown or potentially toxic

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **NEVER eat any Cortinarius species.** The genus contains several deadly species and many of unknown toxicity. They are difficult to distinguish even for experts. The severe, delayed, and irreversible consequences make the risk unacceptable.
