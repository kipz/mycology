**Identification:**
**WARNING: Panther Cap is seriously poisonous and has caused fatalities. It's often confused with the edible (when cooked) Blusher, with tragic results.**

Panther Cap is a medium-sized Amanita. The cap is 5-12cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap is grey-brown to dark brown, covered with pure white warts arranged in concentric rings - these warts are remnants of the universal veil and can wash off in rain. The cap margin is distinctly striated.

The gills are pure white, free from the stem, crowded. The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical, with a bulbous base. The ring is white, pendulous, thin. **Critical feature:** The bulb at the base has a distinct marginate (collared) edge where the volva forms a distinct rim or collar around the top of the bulb - this is diagnostic.

The flesh is white, with no distinctive smell. **Does NOT stain red or pink** - this distinguishes it from the Blusher.

**TOXICITY:** Contains high levels of muscimol and ibotenic acid (similar to Fly Agaric but more concentrated):
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion
- Confusion, dizziness, loss of coordination
- Hallucinations, delirium, agitation
- Seizures possible
- Loss of consciousness
- Can be fatal, especially in children
- Effects last 4-10 hours

**Lookalikes:**
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - EDIBLE when cooked. Pinkish warts, stains red when damaged, no marginate bulb
- **Grey Spotted Amanita** (Amanita spissa) - Grey warts, stains grey, no marginate bulb

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** The marginate (collared) bulb and pure white ring, combined with striated cap margin and NO red staining, are diagnostic. If in any doubt, AVOID all brown-capped Amanitas.

**WARNING:** Several deaths have resulted from confusion with Blusher. Never eat any Amanita unless you are absolutely certain.
