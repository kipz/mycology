**Identification:**
St George's Mushroom is a stocky, white to cream spring mushroom. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flat, sometimes with an undulating margin. The surface is smooth to slightly silky, colored white to cream or pale buff. The gills are white to cream, crowded, sinuate (notched near stem).

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 2-4cm thick, stout, white, solid, fibrous. The flesh is thick, white, firm, with a **distinctive strong mealy smell** (like fresh meal or wet flour). The taste is mild and mealy.

St George's Mushroom grows in grassland, pastures, parks, woodland edges, often forming rings or lines. It's one of few choice edible mushrooms that fruits in spring (April-June), making it seasonally distinctive.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent edible mushroom with firm texture and good flavor. The mealy aroma is distinctive but disappears with cooking. Good fried, grilled, or in creamy dishes. The firm flesh holds up well to cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Deadly Fibrecap** (Inocybe erubescens) - DEADLY. Pinkish staining, fibrous cap, different smell
- **Fool's Funnel** (Clitocybe rivulosa) - DEADLY. Smaller, autumn fruiting, grassland
- **Miller** (Clitopilus prunulus) - Edible. Similar smell but pink spores, autumn fruiting

**CRITICAL SAFETY:** Spring fruiting season helps eliminate confusion with autumn species. The strong mealy smell is characteristic. Always be certain.
