**Identification:**
Tawny Grisette is similar to the Grisette but with a distinctive orange-brown color. The cap is 4-10cm across, initially conical, expanding to flat, with a deeply grooved or striated margin. The cap is orange-brown to tawny-brown, smooth, sometimes with white veil remnants.

The gills are white, free, crowded. **Critical feature:** There is NO ring on the stem - this immediately distinguishes it from most dangerous Amanitas. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white to pale orange-brown, slender, fragile, hollow, with orange-brown snakeskin patterns. The base sits in a large, loose, white to ochre volva sac.

The flesh is white, thin, fragile. Tawny Grisette grows in mixed woodland, especially with birch.

**Safety Note:** While edible when thoroughly cooked, this species is easily confused with deadly Amanitas by beginners. The lack of ring is distinctive. **Must be cooked - toxic when raw.** Due to confusion potential and mediocre quality, best avoided unless expert.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, often greenish
- **Grisette** (Amanita vaginata) - Edible. Grey cap, otherwise similar
