**Identification:**
The Wood Hedgehog is a wonderful edible mushroom with a cap 4-15cm across. The cap is convex when young, becoming irregular and often depressed in the middle with age. The color is creamy yellow to pale flesh/salmon pink. The cap can be uneven with an undulating surface.

**Critical identifying feature:** The undersurface is covered with spines or teeth instead of gills or pores - this makes it a member of the "tooth fungi" group. The spines are cream to pale buff colored, brittle, and hang down from the underside of the cap. They are typically 2-5mm long.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1.5-3cm thick, often off-center or eccentric, colored similarly to the cap or paler, smooth, and solid. The flesh is thick, white, firm, and brittle. It bruises yellow to orange-brown.

**Safety Feature for Beginners:** The Hedgehog Fungus is considered a very safe mushroom for novice foragers. **If you find a light-colored mushroom growing from the ground with a stem and spines (teeth) instead of gills, it can't be anything else but a hedgehog mushroom - and they're all edible.**

Common over much of the UK, with Scotland, Wales, the north, south-west, and south-east of England as strongholds. Grows with both coniferous and deciduous trees, generally found growing with Beech. Forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees. Fruits from late summer through late autumn.

**Culinary Value:**
Wood Hedgehogs are prized for their firm, meaty texture and excellent, sweet, nutty flavor with a crunchy texture. They hold up well to cooking and are commonly sold in European markets. Excellent sautéed in butter, in cream sauces, with eggs, or added to risottos and pasta dishes. Some people prefer to remove the spines before cooking (they can get stuck in teeth), though this isn't necessary.

**Note on Maturity:** Mature specimens can develop a slightly bitter taste, so younger specimens are preferred. The bitterness is not harmful, just less pleasant.

**Similar Species:**
- **Terracotta Hedgehog** (*Hydnum rufescens*) - EDIBLE. Smaller, terracotta/orange-brown color, otherwise similar
- No poisonous lookalikes in UK

**Key Distinction:** The combination of pale cream/salmon color, spiny undersurface (not gills or pores), and growth from soil (not wood) make this unmistakable. The spines are the key - if it has downward-hanging spines and grows from the ground, it's a hedgehog mushroom.

**Excellent for Beginners:** This is one of the safest mushrooms for novice foragers due to its distinctive features and lack of poisonous lookalikes.
