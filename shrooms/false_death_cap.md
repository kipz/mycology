**Identification:**
The False Death Cap is an Amanita species with a cap 5-10cm across that is generally yellow to off-white in color, covered in almost pure white fragments of the universal veil. The cap starts convex and expands to nearly flat. **Critical identifying feature:** The mushroom has a distinct smell of raw potatoes - this is one of the easiest identifying features and distinguishes it from the deadly Death Cap.

The gills are white to cream, free from the stem, and crowded. The stem is 5-12cm tall, white or pale yellow, with a delicate white ring (annulus) and a bulbous base enclosed in a large white volva (cup-like structure at the base). The flesh is white and firm.

Very common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, particularly in mixed and coniferous forests on acidic soils. Found throughout UK and European woodlands, especially after periods of rain from late summer to late autumn.

**Why "False Death Cap"?**
This mushroom gets its name because it can be confused with the deadly Death Cap (*Amanita phalloides*), though there are clear differences. The False Death Cap is now known to contain the toxin alpha-amanitin, though in concentrations so low that it's unlikely to have significant effects in normal amounts. However, the strong advice is NOT to eat Amanita citrina whether raw or cooked.

**Critical Safety Warning:**
The possibility of confusion with deadly Amanita species such as the Death Cap (*Amanita phalloides*) or Destroying Angel (*Amanita virosa*) means this mushroom should NEVER be consumed. All Amanita species with white gills should be treated with extreme caution.

**Distinguishing from Death Cap:**
- **False Death Cap:** Smells strongly of raw potatoes, paler yellow/cream color
- **Death Cap:** Sickly-sweet honey-like odor, often olive-green to greyish color

**Key Distinction:** The strong raw potato smell is diagnostic, but never rely on smell alone when dealing with Amanita species. The stakes are too high - the Death Cap is responsible for over 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide.
