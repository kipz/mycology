**Identification:**
Saffron Milk Cap is a distinctive and prized edible milk cap mushroom. The cap is 4-14cm across, convex becoming flat with a depressed center and inrolled margin. The surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored bright orange to orange-red with concentric zones of darker orange-red. The cap develops green stains with age or damage.

**Diagnostic feature:** When cut or damaged, the flesh exudes a bright orange to carrot-orange latex (milk). This orange milk is distinctive. The gills are orange, crowded, decurrent, staining green when damaged. The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, orange with darker orange depressions or pits, hollow.

The flesh is firm, orange, staining green slowly. It has a mild smell and taste. Saffron Milk Cap grows under pine trees (Pinus), forming mycorrhizal associations.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom, especially in Mediterranean and Eastern European cuisine. Firm texture and distinctive, slightly fruity flavor. Excellent grilled, fried, pickled, or roasted. The green staining is harmless and occurs with cooking. Can cause harmless orange coloration of urine.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Saffron Milk Cap** (Lactarius deterrimus) - Edible. Under spruce, milk reddens slowly
- **Woolly Milk Cap** (Lactarius torminosus) - POISONOUS. Pale pink, hairy cap margin, white milk

**Safety Check:** The orange milk is diagnostic. If milk is white, it's not Saffron Milk Cap.
