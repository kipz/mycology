**Identification:**
Cauliflower Fungus is one of the most distinctive and unmistakable fungi in UK woodlands. The fruiting body is 10-40cm across (occasionally larger), forming a large, creamy-white to pale yellow mass of intricately branched, wavy lobes that truly resembles a cream-colored cauliflower or sea coral. The structure consists of numerous flattened, ribbon-like branches that are crisp and brittle when fresh. The entire fungus grows from a short, rooting stem base that is often buried in the soil or attached to roots.

This fungus grows exclusively at the base of pine trees (Pinus species) in the UK, though it can occur with other conifers elsewhere. It's a parasitic species that causes brown rot of the roots and heartwood, eventually killing the host tree. The same fruiting body can emerge from the same location year after year. The flesh is white to cream, crisp, and brittle when fresh, with a pleasant nutty smell.

Cauliflower Fungus is highly prized as an edible species. The young, fresh specimens have a mild, sweet, slightly nutty flavor and a pleasant crunchy texture. However, **cleaning is challenging** - the intricate folds trap pine needles, soil, and insects, requiring patient washing in multiple changes of water. The flavor is subtle, making it excellent in cream-based dishes, stir-fries, or simply sautéed in butter. It must be cooked thoroughly. Older specimens become tough and rubbery.

**Lookalikes:**
None - this is unmistakable. There is a similar species, S. spathulata, found with oak in southern England, which is equally edible.
