**Identification:**
Scarlet Elf Cup is a stunning bright red cup fungus that brightens winter woodlands. The fruiting body is 1-6cm across, cup or goblet-shaped, brilliant scarlet-red on the inner surface, paler pinkish-white and slightly hairy on the outer surface. The cup is supported by a short white stem.

This fungus grows on dead sticks and branches buried in leaf litter or moss, often in damp, shaded locations. It fruits in winter and early spring when few other mushrooms are present, making it a welcome splash of color.

**Culinary Value:** Not edible due to tough, rubbery texture, though not toxic. Some sources suggest it's been used as decoration on cakes or drinks, but it's too tough to eat.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Orange Peel Fungus** (Aleuria aurantia) - Orange not red, on soil, autumn
- **Scarlet Caterpillar fungus** (Cordyceps militaris) - On buried insect larvae

**Foraging Note:** Beautiful to photograph but not useful for eating. An indicator of healthy woodland with plenty of deadwood.
