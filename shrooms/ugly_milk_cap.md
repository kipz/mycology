*Lactarius turpis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:ugly_milk_cap`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS - Potentially carcinogenic
- **Toxicity:** Contains necatorin, a mutagenic/carcinogenic compound
- **Season:** Late summer to autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Under birch trees on acid soils

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** -2

**Identification:**
The Ugly Milk Cap truly lives up to its name - it looks rotten even when young and fresh. The cap is 5-20cm across, convex then centrally depressed with an inrolled/involute hairy margin. The color is dark olive-brown, umber, or olive-blackish, and the surface is sticky and slimy. The overall appearance is dingy and unappealing.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Always looks rotten:** Dingy, dark, dirty appearance even when fresh
- **Very acrid milk:** When damaged, exudes abundant white latex (milk) with a very hot and acrid taste
- **Hairy rolled margin:** The edge of the cap is distinctly hairy and rolled inward
- **Slimy cap:** Sticky and viscid, especially in wet conditions

The gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, fairly narrow and crowded, cream to yellowish-buff, becoming pale sepia where wounded. The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2.5cm thick, short and stout, colored similarly to the cap or paler, hollow when mature. The surface is often shallowly pitted and slimy.

Fairly common throughout much of Britain and Ireland, appearing under birches on acid soils, especially in wet woodland edges. Fruits from late summer through autumn (August-November), particularly after wet weather.

**Toxicity:**
The Ugly Milk Cap may be carcinogenic and should be considered as POISONOUS. This species contains the compound necatorin, which is mutagenic. Since many mutagens are known carcinogens, this mushroom is NOT recommended for consumption under any circumstances.

While no deadly poisonous mushrooms exist in the genus *Lactarius*, this species contains chemicals that could potentially cause cancer. The very acrid taste also makes it unpalatable.

**One of the Easiest Milkcaps to Identify:**
This is one of the easiest Milkcaps to identify to species - it looks rotten and ugly even when perfectly fresh. The combination of dark, dingy, olive-brown slimy cap, hairy inrolled margin, and "always rotten" appearance make it unmistakable.

**Similar Species:**
No other UK milk cap looks quite as dingy and unappealing as the Ugly Milk Cap. The dark olive colors and perpetually rotten appearance distinguish it.

**Key Distinction:** If you find a milk cap (check for white latex when damaged) that looks rotten, is dark olive-brown, has a hairy rolled margin, and grows under birch - it's the Ugly Milk Cap. Don't eat it!
