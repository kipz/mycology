**Identification:**
The Cep (also known as Penny Bun in the UK and Porcini in Italy) is one of the most highly prized edible mushrooms in the world. The cap is 7-30cm across (occasionally larger), bun-shaped in young specimens, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored various shades of brown - from pale tan to reddish-brown or dark brown. The margin often remains pale, creating a distinctive two-tone effect.

The pore surface is white when very young, becoming yellowish and then greenish-yellow with age. The pores do not bruise blue. The tubes are deeply depressed around the stem apex. **The stem is the key feature:** 8-25cm tall, 2-7cm thick, very robust and bulbous, colored pale brown to buff, and covered with a fine white network (reticulation) over the upper portion - this white net-like pattern is diagnostic.

The flesh is white, thick, firm in young specimens, not changing color when cut. It has a pleasant mild smell and a nutty taste. Ceps form mycorrhizal associations with various trees including oak, beech, birch, pine, and spruce. They often fruit in the same locations year after year, leading to closely guarded "secret spots" among foragers.

**Culinary Value:** Ceps are considered gourmet mushrooms with excellent firm texture and rich, earthy, nutty flavor. They can be eaten in numerous ways: sautéed, grilled, in risottos, pasta dishes, or soups. They dry exceptionally well and dried porcini are a staple of Italian cuisine, used to flavor stocks and sauces. Young, firm specimens are best - check for insect infestation as they're popular with wildlife too.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Bay Bolete** (Imleria badia) - Cap darker bay-brown, less robust, bruises blue-green
- **Bitter Bolete** (Tylopilus felleus) - BITTER. Pink pores, brown reticulation on stem
- **Devil's Bolete** (Rubroboletus satanas) - POISONOUS. Red pores, red on stem

**Warning:** Always check the pore color - white to yellow = good. Red pores = avoid.
