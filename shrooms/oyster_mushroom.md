**Identification:**
Oyster Mushroom is an excellent edible species that grows in shelf-like clusters on dead hardwood. The cap is 5-25cm across, oyster or shell-shaped, smooth, colored greyish-brown to blue-grey when young, becoming paler brown or cream with age. Young specimens often have a bluish tinge. The surface is smooth, slightly moist.

The gills are white to cream, running down the short lateral stem, spaced moderately to widely. The stem is 1-4cm long (or absent), lateral to off-center, white, solid, tough at base. The flesh is white, thick, firm, with a pleasant mild smell and taste.

Oyster Mushrooms grow in overlapping clusters on dead or dying hardwood, especially beech, but also on ash, oak, and other broadleaf trees. They fruit from autumn through winter into early spring - unusual for edible mushrooms. The clusters can be quite large, producing several pounds of mushroom.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom, popular in commercial cultivation. Firm, meaty texture with a subtle, mild, slightly anise-like flavor. Can be sautéed, stir-fried, roasted, grilled, or added to soups and stews. Particularly good in Asian-style dishes. The stems are tough and should be trimmed. Must be cooked - never eat raw.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Bitter Oysterling** (Panellus stipticus) - INEDIBLE. Much smaller, very bitter taste, tougher texture
- **Angel Wings** (Pleurocybella porrigens) - On conifer wood, pure white, thinner. Toxicity concerns - avoid

**Safety Check:** Taste a small piece raw and spit out - should be mild, not bitter. If bitter, it's not Oyster Mushroom.
