**Identification:**
The Lilac Fibrecap is a small to medium-sized deadly poisonous mushroom. The cap is 1.5-3.5cm in diameter, initially conical, flattening as it matures but usually retaining a pointed umbo. **Critical identifying feature:** The caps are lilac in color when young but may fade to light brown with age, often retaining an ochre-colored umbo at the center.

The cap surface is smooth and silky, covered in radial fibres that tend to split along the margins as the mushroom ages. The gills are cream-colored when young, darkening with age, fairly crowded, and adnexed. The stem is 3-7cm tall, slender, lilac with an ochraceous (ochre-colored) base.

**Smell:** Mealy, like damp flour - similar to the white form of this species.

This is one of the most hazardous mushrooms in the UK. It's mycorrhizal and most often found beneath deciduous trees, occasionally near conifers. Found in woods of all kinds during summer to autumn.

**Extreme Toxicity:**
The Lilac Fibrecap contains potentially lethal amounts of muscarine, making it one of the most dangerous mushrooms in Britain. Symptoms of muscarine poisoning include:
- Greatly increased salivation, sweating, and tear flow (15-30 minutes)
- Abdominal pain, severe nausea, and diarrhea
- Blurred vision and labored breathing
- Can be fatal, especially for those with heart or respiratory problems

**Dangerous Confusion Risk:**
This is one of the most hazardous mushrooms in the UK and is often mistaken for edible species:
- **Amethyst Deceiver** (*Laccaria amethystina*) - EDIBLE. Has fibrous stipe, fruity smell, lacks ochre umbo
- The purple/lilac color can mislead foragers into thinking it's the edible Amethyst Deceiver

**Key Distinction:** The Lilac Fibrecap has a mealy (flour-like) smell, whereas the Amethyst Deceiver has a fruity smell. The Lilac Fibrecap has an ochre-colored umbo and stem base, while the Amethyst Deceiver is uniformly purple/lilac. The Amethyst Deceiver also has a fibrous, not smooth, stem.

**NEVER take chances with identification of purple/lilac mushrooms. When in doubt, don't pick it!**
