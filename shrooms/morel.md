### Black Morel
*Morchella elata*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:morel`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible (must be cooked!)
- **Toxicity:** Toxic if eaten raw; can cause gastric upset
- **Season:** Spring to early summer (April-June)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, burnt ground, bark mulch

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 6
- **Saturation:** 0.8
- **Effects:** None (when cooked)

**Identification:**
The Black Morel is one of the most prized edible mushrooms. The fruiting body consists of a deeply pitted cap 4-10cm tall and 3-6cm wide, attached to a hollow stem 5-12cm tall. The cap presents a honeycomb-like texture with elongated pits arranged along parallel vertical ridges.

**Critical identifying features:**
- The ridges are dark - ranging from dark olive-brown to darker brown or black, especially with age
- The pits are more elongated and vertically oriented compared to Common Morels
- The cap is attached to the stem (not free-hanging)
- The entire mushroom (cap and stem) is completely hollow
- Colors range from dark brown to black

The stem is whitish to pale grey, hollow, often with a granular or scurfy texture. The flesh is thin and brittle with a pleasant mushroomy smell.

In Britain, the Black Morel is increasingly common in the south of England and the Midlands, where bark mulch is its stronghold habitat. Also fairly common in South Wales. It favors woodchip beds and burnt grounds. Spring-fruiting morels often appear in the same locations year after year.

**Culinary Value:**
Black Morels are highly prized by chefs and foragers. They have an earthy, nutty flavor and meaty texture. **NEVER eat raw** - raw morels contain toxins that are destroyed by thorough cooking. Cook for at least 10-15 minutes. They are excellent sautéed, in cream sauces, stuffed, or dried for later use. The hollow structure makes them perfect for stuffing.

**Important Safety Notes:**
- NEVER eat raw morels - they contain hydrazine toxins
- Some people are sensitive even to cooked morels - try a small amount first
- Avoid alcohol when eating morels (can cause adverse reactions)
- Clean thoroughly - the pits harbor dirt and insects

**Similar UK Species:**
- **Common Morel** (*Morchella esculenta*) - EDIBLE. Rounder pits, lighter yellow-brown color
- **False Morel** (*Gyromitra esculenta*) - POISONOUS. Brain-like, not honeycomb, not found in UK
- **Morel Rufobrunnea** (*Morchella rufobrunnea*) - EDIBLE. Late summer/autumn fruiting

**Key Distinction:** The elongated vertical pits, dark coloration, and hollow structure from cap to stem base are diagnostic. True morels have pits; false morels have brain-like convolutions.
