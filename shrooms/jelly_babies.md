**Identification:**
Jelly Babies are distinctive rubbery fungi that look superficially like cap-and-stem mushrooms, but beneath the irregular caps the surface is smooth rather than being gilled. The species produces small fruit bodies up to 6cm in height.

The caps are ochre to olive-brown, tinted with olive-green, irregularly shaped, and often furrowed and convoluted. Specimens can be lemon-yellow, golden-yellow, or even orange. The caps are typically 1-3cm across. **Critical identifying feature:** The texture is gelatinous and rubbery, like jelly - hence the common name "Jelly Babies."

The stems are of similar color to the cap or slightly paler, 2-6cm tall, cylindrical, hollow, smooth or slightly granular. The entire fruiting body has a characteristic gelatinous, jelly-like consistency.

The flesh is translucent, gelatinous, and has a mild odor. Spore print is white to pale buff.

Common but localized in Britain and Ireland, where it occurs in all kinds of woodland but most commonly with conifers. Found from summer through autumn, often appearing after periods of rain.

**Edibility Warning:**
The edibility of Jelly Babies is controversial. While some old field guides suggest these are edible and others claim they're inedible, more concerning is that fruit bodies have been found to contain low levels of monomethylhydrazine, a toxic chemical associated with the poisonous False Morel (*Gyromitra esculenta*).

Some historical sources (Charles McIlvaine) considered it good eating, while others describe it as bland or insipid. Given the presence of known toxins, consumption is NOT recommended.

**Distinctive Features:**
The combination of the jelly-like texture, ochre/olive-green color, smooth undersurface (not gilled), and convoluted cap shape make this species quite distinctive. The gelatinous consistency is unusual and diagnostic.

**Similar Species:**
The smooth undersurface and rubbery texture distinguish Jelly Babies from true gilled mushrooms. The irregular, convoluted shape and olive-green tints are characteristic.

**Key Distinction:** The gelatinous, rubbery texture unlike any true mushroom, combined with the smooth undersurface and irregular ochre-olive caps, make this species unmistakable once you've seen it.
