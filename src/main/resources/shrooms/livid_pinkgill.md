**Identification:**
The Livid Pinkgill, also known as "Lead Poisoner," is a large and very poisonous mushroom. The cap is ivory to light grey-brown, up to 20cm across, convex with a margin that is rolled inward. The cap has a smooth, slightly sticky surface. The overall appearance is pale and substantial.

The gills are sinuate (wavy/notched where they meet the stem), pale and often yellowish when young, becoming pink as the spores develop - this pink color from mature spores is a key identifying feature of the *Entoloma* genus. The stem is thick, whitish, 5-15cm tall, 1-3cm thick, and has NO ring.

The mushroom is solid and robust in shape, with a texture and appearance resembling members of the genus *Tricholoma*. The flesh is white and firm.

Although widespread, the Livid Pinkgill is an infrequent find in Britain and Ireland. Fruit bodies appear in late summer and autumn in deciduous woodlands on clay or chalky soils, or in nearby parklands.

**Severe Toxicity:**
The toxins cause severe stomach pains, sickness, and diarrhea, with effects that can be long-lasting. At least one fatality has been attributed to eating these mushrooms. It has been responsible for many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe, causing primarily gastrointestinal problems that are highly unpleasant and potentially dangerous.

**Dangerous Lookalikes:**
Its pallid appearance means inexperienced collectors can confuse it with several edible species:
- **Field Mushroom** (*Agaricus* species) - EDIBLE. Has brown spores and free gills, often has a ring
- **St George's Mushroom** (*Calocybe gambosa*) - EDIBLE. Appears in spring, has white spores
- **The Miller** (*Clitopilus prunulus*) - EDIBLE. Smaller, mealy smell, decurrent gills

To complicate matters, the Livid Pinkgill often grows near these edible species in the same habitats.

**Key Distinction:** The combination of large size, pallid color, PINK gills at maturity (from pink spores), sinuate gill attachment, and absence of a ring are diagnostic. The pink spore color is critical - always check mature specimens for pink gills. White or cream-colored spores rule out *Entoloma*.

**Safety Warning:** Learn to recognize the pink-spored *Entoloma* genus and avoid all species unless you are an expert. Many are poisonous and identification within the genus is difficult.
