*Parasola plicatilis*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:pleated_inkcap`
- **Edibility:** Inedible (too small and insubstantial)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Late spring to autumn (May-November)
- **Habitat:** Short grass, lawns, pastures

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0

**Identification:**
The Pleated Inkcap is a very delicate, tiny mushroom with a plicate (pleated/grooved) cap up to 3.5cm wide (typically 1-2.5cm). The cap surface is pale grey or tan, darkening towards the center, with deep grooves (striae) radiating from the center like the ribs of an umbrella. The cap starts oval when young, expanding to become bell-shaped or slightly convex, never fully flattening.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Pleated appearance:** The deeply grooved, umbrella-like cap is diagnostic
- **Short-lived:** Appears overnight following rain and decays within 24 hours
- **Does not deliquesce:** Unlike many inkcaps, this species does NOT melt into an inky liquid
- The center of the cap is often darker ochre or brown

The gills are white to grey, widely spaced, and attached to a collar around the stem apex. The stem is very delicate, 4-10cm tall but only 1-3mm thick, white to greyish, smooth, fragile, and hollow. The spore print is black.

Common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, this tiny mushroom occurs in short grass throughout the British Isles. If you have a lawn and don't smother it in chemicals, this is one of the little mushrooms you're likely to see in summer and autumn, especially after rain.

**Edibility:**
Though non-poisonous, the species is generally regarded as inedible due to its tiny size and lack of substance. There's no real interest in eating this mushroom because of its lack of flesh. Very few people ever try to eat such a tiny, insubstantial thing.

**Ecological Role:**
This delicate mushroom is saprophytic, helping to decompose organic matter in grassland soils.

**Similar Species:**
- **Parasola auricoma** (Golden-haired Inkcap) - Very similar, distinguished by presence of golden hairs on cap (requires microscopy)
- Various small *Coprinellus* species - Similar habitat and size

**Key Distinction:** The deeply pleated/grooved cap surface like a Japanese parasol, extreme fragility, short-lived nature (appears and disappears within a day), and habitat in short grass make this mushroom distinctive. Unlike most inkcaps, it doesn't deliquesce into black ink.

**Also Known As:** Little Japanese Umbrella (due to its appearance)
