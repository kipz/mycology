**Identification:**
The Red Staining Inocybe (also called Deadly Fibrecap) is a medium-sized, extremely poisonous mushroom. The cap is 4-9cm across, initially bell-shaped, becoming more convex to flat with age. The cap is generally pale pinkish in color with radial fibres.

**Critical identifying feature:** This mushroom is notorious for staining bright red in all parts when damaged or with age - this red staining is diagnostic and gives the species its name. All parts of the mushroom (cap, gills, and stem) develop red stains.

The gills start whitish, gradually turning red/brown with age. The gills stain red when damaged, are crowded, and can be adnate or adnexed. The stem is 4-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, whitish but staining red, especially at the base.

**Smell:** Strong and pungent but hard to describe - sometimes compared to honey, fruit, or perfumed soap.

Common in Southern England where suitable habitat (woodland on chalky/calcareous soil) occurs, reappearing every year in the same locations. Rare in other parts of the country. Mycorrhizal with deciduous trees, most commonly beech and hornbeam.

**Extreme Toxicity:**
The Deadly Fibrecap is a VERY poisonous mushroom containing a lethal concentration of the toxin muscarine. This is the only fibrecap species known conclusively to have caused deaths. One fatality was recorded in Surrey, southern England, in 1937.

Symptoms include gastric upsets, excessive sweating and salivation, slower heart rate, and can lead to death. The antidote is atropine, but medical treatment must be sought immediately.

**Dangerous Confusion:**
Since it appears in spring and summer, it could be confused with St. George's Mushroom (*Calocybe gambosa*), but St. George's lacks the radial fibres and doesn't stain red. This makes the Red Staining Inocybe particularly dangerous for spring foragers.

**Safety Warning:**
ALL Fibrecaps (Inocybe species) are suspected of being very poisonous and should be avoided by foragers entirely. Learn to recognize the fibrous cap texture and avoid the entire genus.

**Key Distinction:** The bright red staining of all parts when damaged or with age is diagnostic. No edible mushroom in the UK shows this characteristic red staining pattern combined with a fibrous cap. If it stains red and has a fibrous cap, DO NOT EAT IT.
