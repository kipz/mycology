**Identification:**
Brown Birch Bolete is a medium to large bolete found exclusively in association with birch trees (Betula species). The cap is 5-15cm across, hemispherical to convex, eventually flattening. The cap color ranges from grey-brown to dark brown or almost black, with a smooth to slightly felty texture. The pore surface is white when young, becoming cream to pale brown with age, bruising slightly greyish-brown when damaged. The tubes are long and deeply depressed around the stem apex.

The stem is distinctive: 8-20cm tall, 1-3cm thick, white to pale grey, and covered with small dark grey to black scales (scabers) that roughen the surface - this scaly stem is a diagnostic feature. The stem is often slightly swollen at the base but lacks a bulb. The flesh is white, soft, and does not change color when cut (or only very slightly). The flesh tends to become water-logged and spongy with age.

Brown Birch Bolete is edible but not highly regarded due to its soft, watery texture and bland flavor. The flesh becomes soggy when cooked and can make dishes watery. It's best used when young and firm, with the tubes removed from older specimens. Must be cooked thoroughly. The mushroom discolors to grey-black when cooked, which is unattractive but harmless. Often appears in large numbers when conditions are favorable.

- **Other Leccinum species** - Various colors, all with scaly stems
