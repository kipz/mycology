### Golden Waxcap
*Hygrocybe chlorophana*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:golden_waxcap`
- **Edibility:** Edible but not recommended (conservation concern)
- **Toxicity:** None confirmed, but some yellow waxcaps are suspect
- **Season:** Autumn to early winter (September-December)
- **Habitat:** Unimproved grassland, old pastures, parkland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Golden Waxcap is a beautiful small to medium mushroom with a cap up to 7.5cm across (typically 3-6cm), distinctly viscid (slimy/sticky) when damp, bright lemon-yellow to orange-yellow, rarely orange to red. The cap is initially convex but becomes flat when expanded, never conical. The surface is smooth and glossy when wet.

The gills are waxy in texture (hence "waxcap"), pale to cap-colored, adnexed (narrowly attached to the stipe). The stem is smooth, cylindrical or slightly compressed and sometimes grooved, cap-colored, and moist to somewhat viscid when damp. The stem is 4-10cm tall and 5-12mm thick.

Restricted to the increasingly scarce habitat of unimproved grassland, the Golden Waxcap is infrequent but far from rare in Britain and Ireland. A common waxcap of cropped pasture and parkland, like nearly all waxcaps it fruits in autumn and early winter. These lovely golden fungi are generally found in small trooping groups; they're sometimes seen in churchyards, but sheep-grazed upland commons are usually much better places to find them.

**Edibility:**
Although reported in many field guides to be edible (albeit of only mediocre flavor), Golden Waxcaps are easily confused with other inedible and possibly suspect yellow waxcap mushrooms. Their flesh is insubstantial, and therefore these fungi are not generally considered worth collecting.

**Conservation:**
Due to the conservation importance of waxcap habitats and the rarity of unimproved grassland, harvesting is strongly discouraged. Waxcap grasslands are considered priority habitats for biodiversity conservation. The Golden Waxcap is fairly common for a waxcap but still uncommon enough to not warrant picking.

**Similar Species:**
- **Hygrocybe ceracea** - Also yellow, but has a waxy (not viscid) cap and broadly attached gills
- Other yellow waxcaps are difficult to distinguish - some may be mildly toxic

**Key Distinction:** The distinctly slimy/viscid cap when wet, bright lemon-yellow color, and habitat in old grassland are key features. However, yellow waxcaps are notoriously difficult to identify to species level.
