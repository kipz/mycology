**Identification:**
The Dotted Stem Bolete is a large, colorful bolete with a bay-brown hemispherical to convex cap that can grow up to 20cm wide. The cap is initially velvety but becomes smooth with age. **Critical identifying feature:** The stem (4-15cm tall, 2-4.5cm diameter) is yellow with a dense covering of red dots that tends to discolor to dark blue/black when touched. Unlike some similar species, the stem has NO network pattern (reticulation).

The pores are small and orange-red when young, yellow in some specimens, becoming rusty with age. These bruise blue to black very quickly. The tubes beneath the cap are yellowish-green. The flesh is yellow and stains blue very rapidly when cut or damaged - this blue bruising is immediate and dramatic.

This mushroom is fairly common in deciduous woodland and pine forests in Britain and Ireland, often found among bilberries. It forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees, particularly on acidic soils.

**Culinary Value:**
While edible when properly cooked, this mushroom can cause vomiting and diarrhea if eaten raw or insufficiently cooked. Some literature recommends cooking it for at least 20 minutes. When properly prepared, it's firm and flavoursome, almost as good as a cep, and less likely to be maggoty. The flavor is excellent, but proper cooking is absolutely essential.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Devil's Bolete** (*Rubroboletus satanas*) - POISONOUS. Very pale lumpy cap, red pores, red reticulated stem
- **Lurid Bolete** (*Suillellus luridus*) - Edible cooked. Red-netted stem (not dotted)
- **Scarletina Bolete** - Same species, alternate common name

**Key Distinction:** The combination of red dots (not a network) on the yellow stem, immediate blue bruising, and orange-red pores are diagnostic. NEVER eat any bolete raw. This mushroom is not recommended for novice foragers due to confusion risk with toxic species.

**Safety Warning:** Great caution should be taken in distinguishing this from any toxic Boletes. The Devil's Bolete has a paler cap and reticulated (netted) stem pattern rather than dots.
