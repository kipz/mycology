**Identification:**
Turkey Tail is one of the most common bracket fungi, named for its resemblance to a wild turkey's tail feathers. The brackets are 3-10cm across, thin, semi-circular to fan-shaped, growing in overlapping tiers on dead logs and stumps. The upper surface shows concentric zones of color including bands of brown, grey, orange, cream, and sometimes blue or green. The surface is finely velvety to smooth.

The underside has tiny cream-colored pores (3-5 per mm). The brackets are thin (1-3mm), flexible when fresh, becoming hard when dry. There is no stem. The flesh is thin, tough, whitish. Turkey Tail is extremely common on dead deciduous wood, especially beech, oak, and birch.

**Medicinal Properties:** Turkey Tail is extensively researched for medicinal properties:
- Polysaccharide-K (PSK) and Polysaccharopeptide (PSP) - immune modulators
- Used as complementary cancer therapy in Japan and China
- Immune system support
- Antioxidant properties
- Gut microbiome support

**Preparation:** Too tough to eat. Made into tea by simmering for several hours, or processed into extracts and supplements.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Turkey Tail** (Stereum ostrea) - No pores on underside (smooth surface)
- Various other multi-colored brackets - Check for tiny pores
