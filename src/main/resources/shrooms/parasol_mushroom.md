### Parasol
*Macrolepiota procera*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:parasol_mushroom`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, woodland edges, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 4
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Parasol is a large, impressive, and excellent edible mushroom. The cap is 10-25cm across (occasionally up to 40cm), initially egg or drum-shaped, expanding to flat with a prominent central umbo. The cap surface is pale cream to buff with large, flat, brown scales arranged in a shaggy pattern, most dense at the center.

The gills are white to cream, free from the stem (with a collar of space), soft, crowded. The stem is 15-30cm tall, 1-2cm thick, very tall and slender, white to grey-brown with brown snakeskin markings (zigzag pattern). The ring is large, thick, double-edged, and movable - you can slide it up and down the stem. The base is slightly bulbous.

The flesh is white, soft, with a pleasant nutty smell and taste. Parasols grow in grassland, woodland edges, parks, and gardens, often appearing singly or in small groups.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom. The cap has excellent flavor - rich, nutty, and meaty. The cap can be prepared like a schnitzel: breaded and fried whole, or sliced and sautéed. The stem is tough and fibrous and should be discarded. Young specimens (before cap opens fully) are best. Only the cap should be eaten.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE but can cause reactions. Smaller, stains orange-red when cut
- **Deadly Dapperling** (Lepiota brunneoincarnata) - DEADLY. Much smaller (cap under 7cm), pinkish scales
- Other small Lepiota species - MANY ARE TOXIC. Never eat small (<10cm cap) mushrooms with free gills and scales

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** Only eat large Parasols with caps over 10cm. The tall stem with snakeskin pattern and movable ring are distinctive. **Never eat small Lepiotas - they can be deadly.**

### Shaggy Parasol
*Chlorophyllum rhacodes*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:parasol_mushroom`
- **Edibility:** Edible with Caution
- **Toxicity:** None (but causes reactions in some people)
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, gardens, compost

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Shaggy Parasol is similar to but smaller than the true Parasol. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially drum-shaped, expanding to flat with or without a low umbo. The surface is white to pale cream with large, shaggy, brown scales that curl upward, most dense at center. The scales are more prominent than Parasol.

The gills are white to cream, free with a collar, crowded. **Critical feature:** The gills and flesh stain orange-red to reddish-brown when cut or bruised - this is diagnostic and distinguishes it from Parasol. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, smooth or with fine scales, white, with a movable ring. The base is bulbous.

The flesh is white, staining orange-red when cut, with a pleasant smell. Shaggy Parasol grows in woodland, gardens, parks, and compost heaps.

**Edibility Concerns:** While considered edible, Shaggy Parasol causes gastric upset in a significant number of people (estimated 10-20%). Reactions include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurring 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating. Some people eat it with no problems while others consistently react badly. **Always try small amounts first if testing this species.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. Larger, no orange-red staining, snakeskin stem pattern
- **Deadly Dapperling** (Lepiota brunneoincarnata) - DEADLY. Much smaller (under 7cm cap)
- **Green-spored Parasol** (Chlorophyllum molybdites) - POISONOUS. Green gills when mature

**WARNING:** Due to individual sensitivity and risk of confusion, many foragers avoid this species. The orange-red staining is diagnostic but doesn't make it safe for everyone.
