**Identification:**
Slippery Jack is a common bolete under pine trees. The cap is 5-12cm across, convex to flat, colored chocolate-brown to purple-brown or reddish-brown. The surface is very slimy when wet (hence "slippery") - the slime can be peeled off. The pore surface is yellow, bruising slightly brownish, with small round pores.

**Diagnostic feature:** The stem has a large, prominent ring that is whitish above and purple-brown and slimy below. This ring with purple-brown undersurface is diagnostic. The stem is 5-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white to yellowish above the ring, brownish below, often with brown glandular dots.

The flesh is white to pale yellow, soft, with faint smell. Slippery Jack grows exclusively under pine trees (Pinus), forming mycorrhizal associations.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly regarded. The slimy cap skin should be removed before cooking. The flesh is soft and can be watery. Some people experience mild gastric upset. Best mixed with other mushrooms. Young specimens are better.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Larch Bolete** (Suillus grevillei) - Under larch, golden-yellow cap, ring less slimy
- **Bovine Bolete** (Suillus bovinus) - No ring, smaller, paler
