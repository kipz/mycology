*Laetiporus sulphureus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:chicken_of_the_woods`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Spring to autumn (May-November)
- **Habitat:** Oak, yew, and other hardwoods

**In-Game Properties:**

- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Chicken of the Woods is one of the most visually striking and unmistakable fungi in the UK. It forms large, spectacular bracket-like shelves in overlapping tiers, each shelf 10-40cm across. The upper surface is bright sulphur-yellow to orange-yellow, smooth to slightly wrinkled, and has a suede-like texture. The underside has tiny sulphur-yellow pores (3-4 per mm). Young fresh specimens are soft, moist, and have a texture remarkably similar to chicken breast when cooked - hence the common name.

The brackets grow directly from tree trunks or from buried roots with no stem. The flesh is thick, white to pale yellow, and soft when young, becoming tough and chalky with age. Only young, fresh, brightly colored specimens are edible - older specimens become tough and can cause gastric upset. This fungus causes brown cubical rot in hardwood trees, particularly oak, yew, willow, and sweet chestnut.

**Culinary Value:** When young and tender, this mushroom tastes remarkably like chicken, making it popular with vegetarians as a meat substitute. The texture is stringy and similar to chicken breast. It can be sliced and sautéed, breaded and fried like chicken schnitzel, or added to stir-fries and curries. **CAUTION:** A small percentage of people experience gastric upset from this species, even when properly cooked. Try a small amount first. Never harvest from yew trees as the fungus can absorb yew toxins.

**Lookalikes:**
None - this combination of bright colors, bracket form, and pore surface is unmistakable. There is a similar species (L. cincinnatus) that grows at the base of oaks, which is equally edible.

**WARNING:** Only eat young, soft specimens. Avoid if growing on yew, laburnum, or other toxic trees. Some people are sensitive - try small amounts first.

### Hen of the Woods
*Grifola frondosa*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:chicken_of_the_woods`
- **Edibility:** Choice Edible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn (September-November)
- **Habitat:** Base of oak trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Hen of the Woods (also known as Maitake) forms large, spectacular, rosette-like clusters of overlapping fan-shaped caps at the base of oak trees. The entire fruiting body can be 20-60cm across and weigh several kilograms. Each individual cap is 2-7cm across, fan or spoon-shaped, grey-brown to greyish, with a finely wrinkled or textured surface.

The undersides have tiny white to cream pores. The caps arise from a branched, white basal stem structure. The flesh is white, firm when young, with a pleasant mushroomy smell. This fungus is parasitic and saprobic on oak, causing white rot. It fruits from the same location year after year.

**Culinary Value:** Highly prized in Japanese cuisine (maitake means "dancing mushroom"). Excellent flavor - rich, earthy, slightly spicy. Firm, meaty texture. Can be sautéed, grilled, roasted, added to soups and stir-fries. Young specimens are best. Older ones become tough. Well-known in medicinal mushroom research for immune-supporting properties.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Black-staining Polypore** (Meripilus giganteus) - Edible when young. Larger, fans stain black when touched
- **Umbrella Polypore** (Polyporus umbellatus) - Edible. More umbrell a-like arrangement

**Foraging Note:** A single hen of the woods can provide many pounds of excellent mushroom. Mark the location and return annually.
