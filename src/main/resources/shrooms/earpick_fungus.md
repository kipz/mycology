**Identification:**
The Earpick Fungus is a small, distinctive mushroom that grows almost exclusively on pine cones. The fruiting body has a dark brown to blackish cap (typically 0.5-2cm wide) covered with fine hairs or bristles, giving it a fuzzy appearance. **Critical feature:** The undersurface has spines or teeth instead of gills or pores - this makes it a member of the "tooth fungi" group.

The stem is thin and lateral (off-center or side-attached), often curved, dark brown to black, and covered in fine hairs. The stem typically measures 2-6cm long and 1-2mm thick. The entire fruiting body has a tough, leathery texture.

The Earpick Fungus grows almost exclusively on buried or partially buried pine cones (especially spruce and pine) in coniferous forests. It's found in cool, moist areas throughout temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The mushroom fruits from late summer through autumn, often persisting into winter due to its tough texture.

**Why "Earpick"?** The common name comes from its resemblance to traditional ear-cleaning tools - the small cap on a thin curved stem looks like an old-fashioned earpick.

**Distinctive Features:**
The combination of growing on pine cones, having spines on the undersurface, and the small dark hairy cap makes this mushroom virtually unmistakable. No other common British fungus shares this specific ecology and morphology.

**Ecological Role:**
Despite its small size, this fungus plays an important role in decomposing fallen pine cones in coniferous forests, helping recycle nutrients back into the forest ecosystem.

**Similar Species:**
There are no similar species that grow on pine cones with spines on the undersurface. The habitat and morphology make this species easy to identify with confidence.
