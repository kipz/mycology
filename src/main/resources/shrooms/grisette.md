**Identification:**
Grisette is a medium-sized Amanita that lacks a ring on the stem - this immediately distinguishes it from most dangerous Amanitas. The cap is 4-10cm across, initially bell-shaped, expanding to flat, with a distinctive deeply striated or grooved margin (extending up to halfway to center). The cap is grey to grey-brown, sometimes paler, smooth with occasional white patches of veil remnants.

The gills are white, free, crowded. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, slender, fragile, hollow, with no ring. The base sits in a loose, white, sac-like volva. The flesh is white, thin, fragile, with no distinctive smell.

**Safety Note:** While edible when thoroughly cooked, Grisette is easily confused with deadly Amanitas by beginners. The lack of a ring is distinctive, but this requires careful observation. **Must be cooked - never eat raw.** Due to confusion potential and mediocre culinary value, best avoided unless expert.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Death Cap** (Amanita phalloides) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, greenish cap
- **Destroying Angel** (Amanita virosa) - DEADLY. HAS a ring, pure white
- **Tawny Grisette** (Amanita fulva) - Edible. Orange-brown cap, otherwise similar
