**Identification:**
Amethyst Deceiver is a small to medium-sized mushroom that fruits abundantly in woodlands during autumn. Its most striking feature is its vivid purple to amethyst coloration when young and fresh, though this "deceives" foragers as it fades significantly with age, becoming buff to pale lilac. The cap is 2-6cm across, convex becoming flatter with a slightly depressed center. The gills are thick, widely spaced, and the same purple color as the cap. The stem is slender (4-10cm tall, 3-8mm wide), fibrous, and often twisted, colored purple throughout.

This mushroom grows in both deciduous and coniferous forests, often forming small troops in mossy areas or among leaf litter. It has a mycorrhizal association with various trees including oak, beech, and pine. While edible, it's not considered choice due to its thin flesh and somewhat tough texture. The purple color fades significantly when cooked. It's generally safe to identify as there are few purple mushrooms in UK woodlands, though the faded specimens can be confused with the similar Deceiver (L. laccata).

**Lookalikes:**
- **Deceiver** (Laccaria laccata) - Similar but orange-brown
- Faded specimens can be difficult to distinguish from common brown woodland mushrooms
