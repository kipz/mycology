### Woolly Milk Cap
*Lactarius torminosus*

**Quick Reference:**

- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Under birch trees, damp areas, acid soil

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** -1
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (0:20), Nausea II (0:30)

**Identification:**
The Woolly Milk Cap is a striking mushroom with a cap 5-12cm across. The cap is a blend of pink and ochre hues, sometimes with concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The color can range from pale pink to deeper salmon-pink.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Shaggy/woolly margin:** The edge of the cap is rolled inward and distinctly shaggy or woolly when young - this is the key identifying feature
- **White or pale cream latex:** When damaged, exudes milk that is very acrid (peppery/burning)
- **Pink-toned cap:** The pinkish coloration combined with the woolly edge is distinctive
- **Decurrent gills:** Shortly decurrent, crowded, pale pink

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, pale pink to cream, often with darker spots, hollow when mature. The flesh is white to pale cream, firm.

In Britain and Ireland, this is a widespread but uncommon species that occurs either solitarily or in small scattered groups. This attractive milk cap is mycorrhizal with birch trees, growing beneath birch trees in damp areas, mainly on acid soil, usually in open grassy sites at the edge of woodland or on heath rather than deep inside dense woods.

**Toxicity:**
The mushroom is POISONOUS when raw and may cause oral blistering. The intensely peppery taste of the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Although it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, the species is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw.

Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing "mild to fatal gastroenteritis." The toxins (responsible for the strongly bitter/acrid taste) are destroyed by cooking, but extensive preparation is required - typically salting and soaking for extended periods.

**Preparation (if attempting):**
In Eastern Europe, this mushroom is pickled after extensive salting and soaking (sometimes for weeks) to remove the acrid taste and toxins. This is NOT a mushroom for casual consumption - leave it for experts familiar with traditional preparation methods.

**Similar Species:**
- **Bearded Milk Cap** (*Lactarius pubescens*) - Also POISONOUS. Paler, less woolly, otherwise similar

**Key Distinction:** The combination of pinkish-ochre zoned cap, distinctly woolly/shaggy inrolled margin, white acrid latex, and growth under birch trees make this species recognizable. The woolly edge is the most distinctive feature.

**Safety Recommendation:** Due to its toxicity when raw and the extensive preparation required, this mushroom is NOT recommended for consumption. There are many better edible species to forage.
