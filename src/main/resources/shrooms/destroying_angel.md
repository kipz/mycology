**Identification:**
**WARNING: Destroying Angel is one of the deadliest mushrooms in the world, containing the same amatoxins as Death Cap. Half a mushroom can kill an adult. There is no antidote. The pure white appearance can make it look innocuous and has led to fatal poisonings.**

Destroying Angel is a medium to large, pure white Amanita. The cap is 5-12cm across, initially conical to bell-shaped, expanding to convex and sometimes flat. The entire mushroom is **pure white or very slightly cream**, giving it an innocent appearance that belies its deadly nature. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, sometimes with a few white patches of veil remnants. The margin is not striated.

The gills are white, free from the stem, crowded. The stem is 7-15cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical or slightly tapering upward, often with a slightly shaggy or scaly surface. It has a large, skirt-like ring that is white and pendant. **The base is buried in a large, sac-like volva (cup)** that is white and often completely hidden in soil - you must dig to see it.

The flesh is white and has a distinctive sweet, sickly smell, sometimes described as like honey or roses. This smell becomes more pronounced as the mushroom ages. Young specimens may have little smell. Taste is reportedly mild (NEVER TASTE THIS MUSHROOM).

**TOXICITY:** Contains amatoxins (alpha-amanitin and related compounds) at similar or higher concentrations than Death Cap:
- **Symptoms delayed 6-24 hours** (by which time toxins have been absorbed)
- Phase 1: Severe vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, dehydration (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: False recovery period (1-2 days) - liver damage continuing
- Phase 3: Liver and kidney failure (3-7 days), jaundice, internal bleeding, often fatal
- **Mortality rate 50% even with treatment**
- Liver transplant may be required
- **Cooking does NOT destroy toxins**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - Gills turn pink then chocolate brown, no volva
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - Gills turn brown, pleasant anise smell, no volva
- **Wood Mushroom** (Agaricus sylvicola) - Gills turn brown, in woodland, no volva

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** Any white mushroom with:
- White gills that stay white
- A ring on the stem
- A volva at the base
= **DEADLY AMANITA - AVOID ENTIRELY**

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:**
1. **NEVER eat a completely white mushroom with white gills, ring, and volva**
2. **ALWAYS dig around the base to check for volva**
3. **The combination of white gills + ring + volva = DEATH**
4. **When in doubt, throw it out**
5. **If you suspect you've eaten Destroying Angel, go to hospital IMMEDIATELY**
