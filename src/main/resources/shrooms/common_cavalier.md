*Melanoleuca polioleuca*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:common_cavalier`

- **Habitat:** Grassland, lawns, pastures, woodland edges

**In-Game Properties:**

**Identification:**
The Common Cavalier has a cap 4-10cm across, convex becoming flat with age, sometimes with a broad umbo. The cap color is variable: grey-brown, buff, pale tan, or sometimes almost white, darker in the center. The surface is smooth to slightly fibrillose and dry. **Critical feature:** The cap often has a slightly streaked or radially fibrous appearance.

The gills are crowded, sinuate (notched near the stem), white to cream, and sometimes develop brownish spots with age. The stem is 4-8cm tall, cylindrical or slightly swollen at the base, tough and fibrous, colored like the cap or paler, often with longitudinal fibers. The flesh is white, firm, with a mealy smell (like raw flour) and mild taste. This species is saprotrophic, growing on soil rich in organic matter.

**Culinary Value:** While edible, the Common Cavalier is of mediocre quality with tough, fibrous flesh and a rather bland flavor. The texture remains somewhat tough even after cooking. Not worth collecting when better mushrooms are available.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other Melanoleuca species - Very similar, requires microscopic features to distinguish
- **St George's Mushroom** (Calocybe gambosa) - Springs only, stouter, better quality, strong mealy smell
- Various tricholomas - Check gill attachment and spore print color

**Key Distinction:** The combination of buff-grey cap, crowded notched white gills, tough fibrous stem, and mealy smell growing in grassland in autumn is characteristic.
