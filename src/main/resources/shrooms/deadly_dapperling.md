**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Dapperling contains the same lethal amatoxins as Death Cap and is responsible for numerous fatal poisonings in Europe.**

Deadly Dapperling is a small to medium-sized mushroom. The cap is 2-7cm across, initially conical, expanding to nearly flat with a low broad umbo. The cap surface is covered with small pinkish-brown to reddish-brown scales concentrated toward the center, with a paler background. The center is darker brown. The gills are white to cream, free from the stem, and crowded.

The stem is 3-7cm tall, 0.5-1cm thick, cylindrical, white above and covered with similar pinkish-brown scales below, especially toward the base. There is a small ring that may be ephemeral and disappear with age. The flesh is white with a faint fruity or unpleasant smell.

This species grows in grassy areas, parks, gardens, and woodland edges. It's often found in association with other small Lepiota species. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms and has caused fatal poisonings.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains amatoxins - the same liver and kidney-destroying toxins found in Death Cap. Despite its small size, it is potentially fatal. Symptoms are delayed (6-24 hours), and by the time they appear, serious organ damage has occurred. Treatment has limited success - liver transplant may be required. **THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE. Much larger, ring movable, no pink tones
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. Much larger (10-25cm cap), tall with snakeskin stem
- Other small Lepiota species - Many are toxic or of unknown edibility

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **NEVER eat small ( mushrooms (cap under 10cm) with free gills and a ring.** Many small Lepiotas are toxic or deadly, and distinguishing species requires microscopy. The risk far outweighs any culinary benefit.
