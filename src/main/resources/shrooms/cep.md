**Identification:**
The Cep (also known as Penny Bun or Porcini) is one of the finest and most prized edible mushrooms. The cap can be impressively large, typically 7-30cm across, occasionally reaching 40cm in diameter. It is light to chestnut brown, smooth, often with a white rim and a hazy pale 'bloom' when young. The cap surface is slightly sticky when wet, becoming dry and velvety. The shape is initially hemispherical, becoming convex and eventually flattening with age.

**Critical feature:** Like all boletes, it has a pore surface (tubes) instead of gills. The pore surface is whitish when young, aging to greenish-yellow. The pores are very fine. The stout stem is 8-20cm tall (rarely to 30cm) and up to 10cm thick, white or yellowish, with a characteristic raised white network pattern (reticulation) on the upper third. This netting is a key identification feature. The flesh is firm, white throughout (except for a narrow claret-colored line just under the cap skin), and does not change color when cut. The smell is pleasant and mushroomy, the taste mild and nutty.

The Cep forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees, found frequently at edges of clearings in both broad-leaved (especially beech, oak) and coniferous (pine, spruce) forests. Often fruits under birch as well. Grows solitary or in small groups.

**Culinary Value:** Boletus edulis is universally regarded as one of the world's finest edible mushrooms. Firm young specimens (buttons) are particularly prized. The flavor is rich, nutty, and intensely mushroomy. Ceps are incredibly versatile - excellent sautéed in butter, in risottos, pasta dishes, soups, with eggs, or as a meat accompaniment. They are especially well-suited to drying, which intensifies their flavor significantly. Dried ceps can be easily reconstituted and are a staple ingredient in many European cuisines, particularly Italian and French cooking. The texture remains pleasant even after drying and rehydration.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Tylopilus felleus** (Bitter Bolete) - NOT POISONOUS but extremely bitter. Pink pore surface, brown reticulation on stem, flesh may pink slightly when cut
- **Boletus badius** (Bay Bolete) - EDIBLE. Darker cap, bruises blue-green, lacks prominent reticulation
- **Other edible Boletus species** - Several similar edible boletes exist

**Key Distinction:** One of the safest mushrooms to forage - no close lookalikes are poisonous, only unpalatable (bitter). The white (not pink or brown) netted pattern on the stem, combined with white unchanging flesh and white-to-yellowish pores, is diagnostic. Avoid any boletes with red or orange pore surfaces.
