**Identification:**
The Hairy Curtain Crust is a bracket fungus that forms thin, leathery, shelf-like fruiting bodies typically 3-10cm long and 1-3cm wide. The brackets are irregularly shaped, semi-circular to fan-shaped, and attach to the substrate without a stem. They grow in overlapping tiers or rosettes.

**Upper Surface:** Generally brown to rust-colored with a finely hairy or felt-like texture (hence "hairy"). One of the distinguishing features is the presence of fine, hair-like structures (setae) on the cap. The surface is often zoned with light and dark bands, creating concentric rings of color.

**Under Surface:** Smooth (or slightly warty), bright yellow to brownish-orange, fading to somewhat ochraceous with age. The fertile surface is smooth, never with pores or gills.

The texture is tough and leathery, making these fungi very persistent. Common and widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, found from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean in Europe, throughout North America, and native to many southern hemisphere countries including Australia.

**Habitat:**
This saprophytic fungus grows on dead hardwood trees and fallen branches, occasionally on conifers. It's particularly common on oak, beech, and maple. The mycelium feeds on dead wood, playing an important role in decomposition and nutrient recycling in forest ecosystems.

**Similar Species:**
- **Turkey Tail** (*Trametes versicolor*) - More colorful with blues, not hairy, pure white underside with pores
- This is the most common misidentification, giving Hairy Curtain Crust the alternate name "False Turkey Tail"

**Key Distinction:** The hairy upper surface, smooth yellow-orange underside (not white with pores like Turkey Tail), and tough leathery texture distinguish this species. Turkey Tail is more commonly in shades of blue/green and has a pure white pored underside.

**Ecological Role:**
Though inedible and of no culinary value, these tough and leathery fungi play a vital ecological role in forest decomposition, breaking down lignin in deadwood.
