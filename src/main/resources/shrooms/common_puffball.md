### Common Puffball
*Lycoperdon perlatum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:common_puffball`
- **Edibility:** Edible (only when pure white inside)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland, grassland, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Common Puffball is one of the most widespread and easily recognized puffball species. The fruiting body is 3-6cm tall and 2-4cm wide, pear-shaped or top-shaped with a rounded head and narrower stem-like base. When young and fresh, the outer surface is white to cream and covered with small conical spines or warts arranged in a distinctive pattern. As the mushroom matures, these spines fall away, leaving a network of scars and a smoother surface that becomes buff to brown.

**Critical edibility check:** Cut the puffball in half from top to bottom. It is ONLY edible when the interior is pure white, firm, and homogeneous throughout like marshmallow. If there is any yellowing, browning, purple tinge, or development of internal structure (gills, distinct chambers), it is past edible stage. The base tapers to a short sterile stem that is spongy and inedible.

When mature, the top develops a small hole (ostiole) through which olive-brown spores puff out like smoke when the fruiting body is compressed - hence "puffball." The Common Puffball grows in woodland, parks, and grassland, often in troops or fairy rings. It has a mild, mushroomy smell.

**Culinary Value:** When young and pure white inside, puffballs have a mild, pleasant taste and firm texture. They can be sliced and fried in butter, added to soups, or breaded and fried. Remove the tough outer skin before cooking. The mild flavor makes them versatile. They don't store well and should be used fresh.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Thick leathery skin, purple-black inside, warty surface
- **Stump Puffball** (Lycoperdon pyriforme) - Edible. Similar but grows on wood, clustered
- **Giant Puffball** (Calvatia gigantea) - Edible. Much larger

**Safety Rule:** ONLY eat when cut open reveals pure white interior with no structures or discoloration.

###Cramp Balls / King Alfred's Cakes
*Daldinia concentrica*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Edibility:** Inedible
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Year-round (perennial)
- **Habitat:** Dead ash wood

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** N/A
- **Saturation:** N/A
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
Cramp Balls is a distinctive fungus forming hard, black, hemispherical or ball-like structures on dead ash branches and logs. Each ball is 2-8cm across, initially reddish-brown when developing under the bark, emerging as shiny black to dark brown hemispherical lumps. The surface is hard and brittle, minutely warty or pimpled with the tiny ostioles (pore openings) of the perithecia. When mature, the surface is dull black.

The most distinctive feature is revealed when the fungus is cut or broken in half - the interior shows concentric zones of silver-grey and black in alternating rings, like tree rings. These zones represent yearly growth layers. This concentrically zoned interior is diagnostic. The entire structure is rock-hard and woody. Each "ball" can persist for several years, growing larger each season.

This fungus is almost exclusively found on dead ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) in the UK, though it can rarely occur on other hardwoods. It's a pyrenomycete, producing spores in flask-shaped chambers embedded in the stroma. The common name "King Alfred's Cakes" comes from the legend of King Alfred burning cakes - the blackened appearance resembles burnt cakes. "Cramp Balls" refers to historical folk use - people carried them in pockets to ward off cramps and rheumatism.

While not toxic, Cramp Balls are completely inedible due to their rock-hard, woody texture. Historically, the dried balls were used as tinder for starting fires and would smolder for a long time. They're an excellent indicator of ash trees and play a role in deadwood ecology.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Beech Woodwart** (Hypoxylon fragiforme) - Smaller, reddish-brown, on beech
- **Coal Fungus** (Hypoxylon) species - Similar but smaller, different colors
