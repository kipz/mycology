**Identification:**
Clustered Bonnet is a small mushroom that forms dense, tightly packed clusters on oak stumps and logs. Each individual cap is 1-4cm across, bell-shaped to conical, colored pale brown to grey-brown with a slightly darker, striated margin when moist. The cap surface is smooth and hygrophanous (changes color with moisture). The gills are white to pale cream, adnexed (just attached to the stem), and develop reddish-brown spots with age - this spotting is a diagnostic feature.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, very thin (1-3mm), hollow, fragile, and colored pale at the top, darker brown toward the base. The stems are often curved or "inclined" (hence the species name inclinata), especially those growing on the sides of logs. The flesh is thin, fragile, and has a distinctive smell like rancid fat or meal. Taste is bitter.

This species is specific to oak (Quercus), growing on dead stumps, logs, and buried wood. It plays an ecological role in wood decomposition but is far too small, tough, and bitter to be considered for eating. The dense clustering habit, oak specificity, and red-spotted gills help distinguish it from other small Mycena species.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other Mycena species - Most don't grow in such dense clusters on oak
- **Oak-stump Bonnet** (Mycena inclinata) - Nearly identical (may be same species)
