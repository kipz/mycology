**Identification:**
Fly Agaric is one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable mushrooms in the world. The cap is 8-20cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to convex and finally flat. The cap surface is a brilliant scarlet-red to orange-red, covered with white to yellowish-white warts or patches (remnants of the universal veil). These warts can wash off in heavy rain. The cap margin is often striated.

The gills are white to cream, free from the stem, and crowded. The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-3cm thick, white, slightly bulbous at the base with concentric rings or bands above the bulb rather than a distinct volva sac. There is a large, white, skirt-like ring on the upper stem that is often torn or shaggy. The flesh is white, yellowish just under the cap skin, with a faint smell.

**TOXICITY:** Contains ibotenic acid and muscimol (not muscarine despite the name). These are psychoactive compounds causing:
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Drowsiness, dizziness, lack of coordination
- Confusion, hallucinations, delirium
- Muscle twitching, jerking movements
- Usually not fatal but can be dangerous, especially for children
- Effects last 4-10 hours

**Cultural Note:** Historically used as intoxicant in Siberian shamanic rituals. Despite its iconic status and some historical use, it should be avoided due to unpredictable effects and toxicity.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Caesar's Mushroom** (Amanita caesarea) - EDIBLE but not found in UK, orange cap, yellow gills
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - Edible when cooked, brownish cap with pinkish warts, flushes red

**WARNING:** Never eat Fly Agaric. While rarely fatal, the effects are unpredictable and unpleasant.
