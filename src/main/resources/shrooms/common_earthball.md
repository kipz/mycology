### Common Earthball
*Scleroderma citrinum*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:common_earthball`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Woodland and heathland

**In-Game Properties:**

- **Effects:** Poison I (400 ticks), Confusion I (300 ticks)

**Identification:**
Common Earthball is a dangerous mushroom that is sometimes mistaken for edible puffballs, leading to poisonings. The fruiting body is 3-10cm across, roughly spherical to irregular in shape, sitting on or partially buried in the ground. **Critical difference from puffballs:** The outer skin (peridium) is thick (2-5mm), hard, and leathery, colored yellowish-brown to ochre, and covered with small warts or scales that form a mosaic-like pattern.

The base is attached to the ground by thick white mycelial cords. When cut open, the interior is initially white, quickly becoming purple-black to black and firm. This black interior is solid and marbled (not powdery), divided into compartments - **puffballs are white and fluffy inside when edible, never purple-black and solid**. When fully mature, the earthball cracks irregularly at the top to release spores. The smell is unpleasant, earthy, and pungent.

**TOXICITY:** Common Earthball contains toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress including violent vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea within 1-3 hours of eating. While rarely life-threatening, the symptoms are very unpleasant and can require medical treatment. The toxins are not destroyed by cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Giant Puffball** (Calvatia gigantea) - EDIBLE. Much larger, pure white inside, thin skin, no scales
- **Common Puffball** (Lycoperdon perlatum) - EDIBLE when white inside. Pear-shaped, thin skin, spiny then smooth
- **Stump Puffball** (Lycoperdon pyriforme) - EDIBLE when white inside. Grows on wood, thin skin

**Safety Rule:** NEVER eat any puffball-like fungus unless you have cut it in half and confirmed:
1. Pure white inside (no hint of purple, pink, yellow, or black)
2. Uniform texture throughout (no developing gills or distinct internal structure)
3. Thin, papery skin (not thick and leathery)
