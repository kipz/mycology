**Identification:**
Stinkhorn is one of the most distinctive and bizarrely-shaped fungi. It starts as a white "egg" (3-6cm across) partially buried in soil or leaf litter. This egg ruptures and rapidly (within a few hours) extends a white, spongy, hollow stem (10-25cm tall) topped with a dark olive-brown, bell-shaped, honeycombed head covered in slimy, foul-smelling spore mass.

**The smell is the key feature:** When mature, Stinkhorn produces an incredibly strong, putrid smell like rotting flesh or sewage. This attracts flies which disperse the spores. The smell can be detected from many meters away. The stem is white, hollow, spongy. After flies remove the spore mass, the head appears yellowish and honeycomb-patterned.

**Edibility:** Only the egg stage is edible (before the stem emerges). The eggs have a radish-like flavor and are considered a delicacy in some European and Asian countries. Once the stem emerges and the smell develops, it's not eaten (though not toxic).

**Culinary Note:** Stinkhorn eggs are eaten raw or cooked in parts of Eastern Europe and China. They must be identified by cutting open to show the developing stinkhorn inside the jelly-like egg.

**Lookalikes (egg stage):**
- **Immature Amanitas** - POTENTIALLY DEADLY. Cut open - if it shows developing gills and cap structure (not stinkhorn), AVOID
- **Earthballs** - Purple-black inside when cut

**Safety Rule:** Only eat if you're certain it's a stinkhorn egg by cutting it open lengthwise to reveal the developing structure.
