### Oak Milk Cap
*Lactarius quietus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:oak_milk_cap`
- **Edibility:** Disputed - not recommended
- **Toxicity:** None (but unpleasant smell/taste)
- **Season:** Autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Exclusively under oak trees

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 1
- **Saturation:** 0.2
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Oak Milk Cap (also called Oakbug Milkcap) is a medium-sized mushroom growing up to 7cm tall and 8cm across. The cap is rounded when young, flattening with age and developing a shallow dimple in the center. The cap displays a dull, reddish-brown color with cinnamon tints, often ringed by concentric bands of darker spots or zones.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Smell:** Distinctive strong oily scent - also likened to bedbugs or wet laundry. This smell is one of the easiest identifying features
- **Milk:** When damaged, exudes white milk that is very plentiful and has a mild to slightly bitter taste
- **Habitat:** Found exclusively under oak trees - this specificity is diagnostic

The gills are pale pinkish-buff, crowded, slightly decurrent or adnate. The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, pale brown, often darker towards the base, hollow in mature specimens.

Very common and widespread in Britain and Ireland, the Oakbug Milkcap is found throughout UK and European woodlands. It grows solitarily or in scattered groups in autumn months, particularly after rain. This mushroom forms an important mycorrhizal relationship with oak roots.

**Edibility:**
The edibility is disputed. It's not poisonous, but the smell and taste are off-putting. Some sources say that the bitter taste of the fresh mushroom largely disappears on cooking, with the final flavor described as "carrot with a hint of ginger." However, most sources do not recommend it due to the unpleasant smell and mediocre flavor.

Technically edible but generally not considered worth collecting for consumption.

**Ecological Importance:**
Despite its poor culinary reputation, the Oak Milk Cap is an important mycorrhizal partner for oak trees, helping them absorb nutrients and water from the soil.

**Similar Species:**
- **Other Lactarius species** - Many milk caps look similar; check habitat (oak trees) and smell
- The distinctive oily/bedbug smell is fairly unique among British Lactarius species

**Key Distinction:** The combination of exclusive association with oak trees, strong oily/bedbug smell, and concentric bands on the reddish-brown cap make this species identifiable with practice. As with all Lactarius species, check for the milky latex when the flesh is damaged.
