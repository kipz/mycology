*Agaricus xanthodermus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:yellow_stainer`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Grassland, gardens, woodland edges

**In-Game Properties:**

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Yellow Stainer is the most common cause of mushroom poisoning in the UK. It closely resembles edible field and horse mushrooms, leading to frequent misidentification.**

Yellow Stainer looks very similar to edible Agaricus species. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flat, white to cream, smooth. The gills are free, starting white, turning pink then chocolate-brown with spore maturity. The stem is 6-12cm tall, 1.5-2cm thick, white, with a ring. There is no volva.

**DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:**
1. **Bright chrome-yellow staining:** When the cap surface or stem base is scratched, rubbed, or bruised, it immediately stains bright chrome-yellow (like a yellow highlighter pen). This staining is the key identification feature.
2. **Chemical smell:** The mushroom has an unpleasant chemical smell like phenol, ink, or disinfectant - especially noticeable when cooking. This is completely different from the pleasant mushroom smell of edible Agaricus species or the aniseed smell of Horse Mushroom.

Yellow Stainer grows in grassland, pastures, gardens, parks, and woodland edges - the same habitats as edible species.

**TOXICITY:** Contains phenolic compounds that cause:
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually resolves in 6-24 hours
- Rarely serious but very unpleasant
- Some people are more sensitive than others

**Lookalikes:**
- **Field Mushroom** (Agaricus campestris) - EDIBLE. Pleasant smell, no yellowing or only slight yellowing
- **Horse Mushroom** (Agaricus arvensis) - EDIBLE. Aniseed smell, may yellow slightly but not bright chrome-yellow
- **Wood Mushroom** (Agaricus sylvicola) - EDIBLE. Aniseed smell, slight yellowing

**CRITICAL SAFETY TESTS:**
1. **Staining test:** Press stem base firmly - if it turns bright chrome-yellow, DO NOT EAT
2. **Smell test:** If it smells chemical, phenolic, or like ink, DO NOT EAT
3. **Cooking test:** The chemical smell intensifies dramatically when cooking

**Rule:** When collecting Agaricus mushrooms, ALWAYS perform the staining and smell tests. Yellow Stainer is the main reason to be cautious with white mushrooms.
