### Deadly Fibrecap
*Inocybe erubescens*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:deadly_fibrecap`
- **Edibility:** DEADLY
- **Toxicity:** LETHAL
- **Season:** Spring to summer (May-August)
- **Habitat:** Deciduous woodland, parks

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Poison II (800 ticks), Confusion I (600 ticks)

**Identification:**
**WARNING: Deadly Fibrecap contains the highest levels of muscarine of any mushroom - up to 20 times more than Fly Agaric. It has caused fatalities.**

Deadly Fibrecap is a medium-sized Inocybe species. The cap is 3-9cm across, initially conical with a prominent central umbo, expanding but retaining the umbo. The cap surface is radially fibrous (hence "fibrecap"), colored white to cream when young, developing pink to reddish-pink tones, especially toward the margin when bruised or with age. The center remains paler. The gills are initially white, becoming grey-brown, adnexed to almost free, crowded.

The stem is 4-10cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical or slightly swollen at base, white, solid, often bruising pinkish-red like the cap. The flesh is white, thick, turning pink-red slowly when cut or damaged. This pinkish-red bruising is diagnostic but **does not appear immediately**. The smell is described as fruity or spermatic (similar to Hawthorn blossom). The taste is said to be mild to slightly bitter (NEVER TASTE).

This species fruits in late spring to early summer under deciduous trees, particularly in parks and along woodland paths. **It has been mistaken for edible mushrooms including St George's Mushroom, leading to serious poisonings.**

**TOXICITY:** Contains extremely high concentrations of muscarine, which causes "muscarinic syndrome":
- Symptoms appear within 15-30 minutes (unlike amatoxin poisoning)
- SLUDGE syndrome: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastrointestinal distress, Emesis
- Excessive sweating, tearing, drooling
- Bradycardia (slow heart rate), bronchial constriction, respiratory distress
- Can be fatal without treatment (atropine antidote available)
- Death can occur from respiratory failure

**Lookalikes:**
- **St George's Mushroom** (Calocybe gambosa) - EDIBLE. No red staining, mealy smell, different season/habitat
- Other Inocybe species - Many are toxic to varying degrees; none should be eaten

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULE:** **AVOID all Inocybe species entirely.** They are difficult to distinguish, and many are poisonous. The genus has a poor risk-benefit ratio for foragers.
