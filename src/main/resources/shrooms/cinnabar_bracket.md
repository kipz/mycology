**Identification:**
Cinnabar Bracket is a small to medium-sized bracket fungus that is instantly recognizable by its brilliant orange-red to cinnabar-red color. The brackets are 3-10cm across, roughly semicircular or kidney-shaped, thin and leathery, growing singly or in overlapping tiers. The upper surface is smooth to slightly zoned, colored bright orange-red when fresh and young, fading to dull orange-brown with age and exposure to sunlight. The entire fungus, including the pore surface, is the same bright color.

The pore surface has very small pores (4-5 per mm), creating an almost smooth appearance. There is no stem - the bracket attaches laterally to the wood. The flesh is thin (1-3mm), tough, and corky, colored similarly throughout. This fungus is a white rot species growing on dead branches and logs of hardwood trees, particularly beech, but also oak, ash, and sycamore. It persists year-round but is most noticeable in winter when the vibrant color stands out.

The brilliant color comes from the pigment cinnabarin, which has antifungal and antibacterial properties. While not toxic, the fungus is far too tough and woody to be edible. In traditional medicine, related species have been used for various purposes, but there is limited research on this specific species. It plays an important ecological role in deadwood decomposition.

**Lookalikes:**
None in the UK - no other bracket is this consistently bright orange-red throughout.
