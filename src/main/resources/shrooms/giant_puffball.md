**Identification:**
Giant Puffball is one of the most impressive and unmistakable edible fungi. The fruiting body is truly giant: 10-80cm across (occasionally over 1 meter), roughly spherical to slightly flattened, white when young. There is no stem - the puffball sits directly on the ground or has minimal basal attachment. The outer surface is smooth, white, sometimes developing a very fine texture like chamois leather.

**Critical edibility check:** Cut the puffball in half from top to bottom. It is ONLY edible when:
1. The interior is pure white throughout - like firm marshmallow or tofu
2. There is NO hint of yellow, brown, purple, or any internal structure
3. The texture is firm and homogeneous

Once the interior begins to turn yellow or develops spores, it is past edible stage and will cause gastric upset. When fully mature, the interior becomes a mass of olive-brown spores like dust.

Giant Puffballs grow in nutrient-rich grassland, meadows, pastures, parks, and woodland edges. They often appear in the same location year after year. A single specimen can provide several pounds of edible mushroom.

**Culinary Value:** When young and white inside, Giant Puffball is excellent eating. The flavor is mild and slightly nutty. The texture is firm and meaty. It can be:
- Sliced into "steaks" and fried in butter
- Breaded and fried like schnitzel
- Cut into cubes for soups and stews
- Added to stir-fries
- Used as a pizza base (slice horizontally)

Remove the tough outer skin before cooking. The mild flavor makes it versatile and it absorbs other flavors well.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Earthball** (Scleroderma citrinum) - POISONOUS. Much smaller, thick leathery skin, purple-black inside, warty
- **Immature Amanitas (egg stage)** - POTENTIALLY DEADLY. Much smaller, when cut shows outline of developing mushroom inside, not homogeneous

**Safety Rule:** ALWAYS cut open any puffball before eating. Only eat when pure white inside with no structures visible.
