**Identification:**
The Glistening Inkcap is a small mushroom with caps around 1-4cm in size, generally ochre-colored with a darker cinnamon-brown center. **Critical identifying feature:** Fresh caps are covered in tiny white granules that appear glittery or glistening like a light dusting of salt or mica - hence both common names "Glistening Inkcap" and "Mica Cap". This coating will eventually disappear with age and weather.

The cap is initially oval to bell-shaped, expanding with age, with radial grooves visible from the edge. The gills are white at first, gradually turning pale brown, then darker brown, eventually black, and finally deliquescing (liquefying) into an inky fluid. The stem is 3-10cm tall, white, hollow, and fragile.

Extremely common and always found in small to large, tightly packed groups on or around broadleaf stumps/wood and buried wood. Found throughout Britain and Ireland wherever suitable deadwood habitat exists. Fruits from mid to late spring all the way through to late autumn/early winter.

**Culinary Value:**
Unlike the Common Inkcap (*Coprinopsis atramentaria*) which reacts with alcohol and is toxic, the Glistening Inkcap is an edible species, although it has little nutritional value or taste. **Important:** Cooking must happen immediately after collection as the mushrooms begin to autodigest (deliquesce) within one hour of picking. The mushrooms dissolve quite quickly upon cooking and are not considered the best tasting, so they're best used as a soup or stock base.

**Safety Warning:**
This edible mushroom is potentially poisonous if collected from roadsides or polluted land, where the mycelium can bioaccumulate heavy metals such as cadmium and lead. Only collect from clean woodland areas away from roads and industrial sites.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Common Inkcap** (*Coprinopsis atramentaria*) - TOXIC WITH ALCOHOL. Larger, lacks mica coating, greyish color
- **Fairy Inkcap** (*Coprinellus disseminatus*) - Edible. Much smaller, grows in huge numbers

**Key Distinction:** The glistening "mica" coating on fresh specimens is diagnostic. After rain washes this off, they can look similar to other inkcaps, so only collect specimens with visible mica crystals on the cap.
