**Identification:**
Brown Roll Rim is a dangerous mushroom that was once considered edible but is now known to be potentially lethal. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex with a strongly inrolled margin (hence "roll rim"), becoming flatter but usually retaining the inrolled edge throughout its life. The cap surface is sticky when wet, brown to olive-brown or rust-brown, with a matt, slightly felt-like texture. The gills are unusual - they are decurrent (running down the stem), yellowish-brown, crowded, and easily separable from the cap flesh (forked and interconnected). **Diagnostic feature:** The gills bruise dark brown to blackish when touched.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, slightly paler than the cap, solid, and often off-center. The flesh is pale yellowish-brown, soft, and bruises brown. There is no ring or volva. The mushroom has a mild smell and taste (though never taste this species). Brown Roll Rim is very common in mixed woodland, parks, and gardens, often forming mycorrhizal associations with birch and pine.

**EXTREME DANGER:** This mushroom contains a unique toxin that causes an autoimmune reaction. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Even if eaten without immediate ill effects, the toxin can cause the development of antibodies that attack red blood cells. Repeated consumption leads to accumulation of these antibodies, and a subsequent meal can trigger sudden and severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), potentially leading to kidney failure and death. There is no antidote. **Several deaths have been recorded, including experienced mycologists who ate this species repeatedly over years before succumbing.**

**Lookalikes:**
- Various brown gilled mushrooms, but the inrolled margin and darkly bruising, removable gills are distinctive

**WARNING:** NEVER eat this mushroom. Historically listed as edible with caution (after parboiling), but now known to be dangerous even when cooked. Avoid entirely.
