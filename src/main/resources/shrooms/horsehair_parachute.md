### Horsehair Parachute
*Gymnopus androsaceus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:horsehair_parachute`
- **Edibility:** Inedible (too small and tough)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** June to November
- **Habitat:** Dead wood, fallen leaves, needle litter

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Horsehair Parachute is a tiny, delicate mushroom with a cap 0.4-1cm across. The cap is initially convex, flattening with a depressed center at maturity. It's dry, smooth, radially grooved and wrinkled, pinkish-buff in the center but usually much paler towards the margin. The cap can appear almost translucent when moist.

**Critical identifying features:**
- The gills are attached directly to the stem and not to a collar (unlike the similar Collared Parachute)
- The stem is remarkably long in comparison with the size of the cap - typically 3-8cm long but only about 0.5-1mm thick
- The stem is dark reddish-brown to blackish, tough, wiry, and hair-like (hence "horsehair")
- **Distinctive feature:** Fine horsehair-like threads of densely interwoven mycelium extend outwards from the stem base

The gills are widely spaced, pale pinkish to buff-colored, and adnate (attached to the stem). The entire mushroom has a tough, wiry texture and can persist for a long time without decomposing.

Common on dead wood, fallen twigs, leaves, and conifer needle litter in woodlands throughout Britain and Ireland, from June to November. The mushrooms often appear in large numbers, creating a miniature forest of tiny parachutes.

**Edibility:**
Inedible due to its tiny size and tough, leathery texture. There's simply not enough substance to make collecting worthwhile, even if they weren't tough.

**Similar Species:**
- **Collared Parachute** (*Marasmius rotula*) - Has a collar where gills attach, white cap, stem not as dark
- *Hemimycena tortuosa* - Much smaller, grows on fallen broadleaf wood in wet places

**Key Distinction:** The combination of the very long, dark, horsehair-thin stem, tiny pale cap, and horsehair-like mycelial threads make this species distinctive. The lack of a collar where the gills attach separates it from the Collared Parachute.

**Ecological Role:**
Despite being inedible, these tiny mushrooms play an important role in decomposing fallen wood and leaf litter in forest ecosystems.
