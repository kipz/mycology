**Identification:**
The Chanterelle is one of the most sought-after and distinctive edible mushrooms. The fruiting body is 2-10cm across, funnel-shaped or irregularly vase-shaped with a wavy, lobed margin. The entire mushroom is a beautiful egg-yolk yellow to golden-orange color. **Critical feature:** What appear to be gills are actually blunt, forked ridges or veins that run down the stem - these are not true gills. The ridges are thick, widely spaced, and forked repeatedly.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, solid, continuous with the cap, and colored like the cap or paler. The flesh is white to pale yellow, thick and firm, with a distinctive fruity aroma often compared to apricots. The taste is mildly peppery when raw (always cook - never eat raw). Chanterelles form mycorrhizal associations with various trees including oak, beech, birch, pine, and spruce. They often fruit in troops or fairy rings and return to the same locations year after year.

**Culinary Value:** Chanterelles are prized for their firm, meaty texture and fruity, peppery flavor. They hold up well to cooking and are excellent sautéed in butter with garlic, in cream sauces, with eggs, or added to pasta dishes and risottos. They should not be washed excessively as they absorb water readily - brush off dirt instead. Cook thoroughly. They freeze well but don't dry as successfully as some other mushrooms.

**Lookalikes:**
- **False Chanterelle** (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca) - INEDIBLE. True gills (not ridges), more orange, thinner flesh
- **Jack O'Lantern** (Omphalotus olearius) - POISONOUS. True gills, grows on wood, not found in UK

**Key Distinction:** Run your finger under the cap - true chanterelles have blunt, forked ridges that don't separate easily from the cap. False chanterelles have thin, separate gills.
