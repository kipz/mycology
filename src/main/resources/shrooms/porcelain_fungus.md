**Identification:**
Porcelain Fungus is a delicate, beautiful mushroom found exclusively on beech trees. The cap is 2-8cm across, convex to flat, semi-translucent, colored white to pale grey or cream with a translucent, striated margin. The surface is smooth and covered with thick, slimy mucus when moist - extremely slippery and gelatinous.

The gills are white, widely spaced, adnexed, thick. The stem is 4-10cm tall, slender, white above a ring, darker grey-brown below, with a distinct ring that is slimy on the underside. The flesh is white, thin, with no distinctive smell.

This mushroom grows on living beech trunks and branches, often high up, in clusters. The combination of slimy cap, translucent appearance, and exclusive beech association makes it distinctive.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not particularly worthwhile. The flesh is thin and the cap is very slimy. Some people enjoy it for the interesting texture. The slime should be rinsed off or the caps dried before cooking. Mild flavor.

**Lookalikes:**
None on beech with this slimy, translucent appearance.
