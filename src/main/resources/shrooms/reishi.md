**Identification:**
Reishi is a distinctive bracket fungus with a kidney or fan-shaped cap and often a lateral stem. The cap is 5-30cm across, semi-circular to kidney-shaped, with a shiny, lacquered appearance when fresh. The surface is marked with concentric zones of color ranging from red-brown to orange-brown to yellow, with a white to cream growing margin. The surface develops a hard, varnished crust.

The underside has tiny white to cream pores that bruise brown. The stem (when present) is lateral, 5-15cm long, dark brown to black, varnished like the cap. The flesh is corky, tough, pale brown, woody. This fungus grows at the base of hardwood trees and stumps, particularly oak.

**Medicinal Properties:** Reishi is one of the most famous medicinal mushrooms, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for over 2,000 years:
- Immune system modulation
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Potential anti-cancer properties (ongoing research)
- Cardiovascular support
- Stress reduction and sleep support

**Preparation:** Too woody to eat. Sliced and simmered for hours to make medicinal tea, or processed into extracts and supplements. The tea is bitter.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Artist's Bracket** (Ganoderma applanatum) - Hoof-shaped, grey-brown upper surface, not varnished
- Other Ganoderma species - Various appearances
