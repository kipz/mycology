**Identification:**
Orange Birch Bolete is a striking bolete found exclusively with birch trees. The cap is 8-20cm across, hemispherical to convex, colored bright orange-red to reddish-brown or rusty-orange. The cap margin typically overhangs the pores. The surface is smooth to slightly felty.

The pore surface is pale grey to cream when young, becoming brownish with age, bruising grey-brown. The tubes are deeply depressed around the stem apex. The stem is 10-20cm tall, 2-4cm thick, robust, white to pale grey, covered with small black or dark grey scales (scabers) that roughen the surface. The stem base is often swollen and may show blue-green staining.

The flesh is white, firm when young, turning grey-violet then black when cut (distinctive). This dramatic color change is characteristic. Must be cooked thoroughly.

**Culinary Value:** Edible but not highly prized. The flesh becomes soft and watery when cooked and discolors dramatically to grey-black, which is unattractive but harmless. Young, firm specimens are better. The spongy pores should be removed from older specimens.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Brown Birch Bolete** (Leccinum scabrum) - Brown cap, less color change, same habitat
- Other Leccinum species - Various colors, all with scaly stems
