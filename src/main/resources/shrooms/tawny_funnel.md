### Tawny Funnel
*Paralepista flaccida*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:tawny_funnel`
- **Edibility:** Edible but poor quality
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn to early winter (September-December)
- **Habitat:** All kinds of woodlands

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Tawny Funnel is a medium-sized mushroom with a cap 5-9cm across. Initially flattened-convex, the cap becomes distinctly funnel-shaped with age. The cap is smooth, pale ochraceous buff when young, becoming more tawny or orangey with maturity.

**Distinctive features:**
- **Jug-like shape:** The cap frequently has a spout-like low point, giving a jug or pitcher-like appearance - this is characteristic
- **Deeply decurrent gills:** The gills run far down the stem, are crowded, off-white when young, becoming pale tawny when mature
- **Thin flesh:** Much thinner cap flesh compared to similar species

The stem is 3-7cm tall, 5-12mm thick, colored similarly to the cap or paler, smooth, and often curved. The flesh is thin, pale buff, with no distinctive smell. Spore print is white or cream.

Found in all kinds of woodlands, the Tawny Funnel is a very common and widespread fungus throughout Britain. It appears on nearly every autumn forest foray. Grows gregariously, often in arcs or scattered groups.

**Culinary Value:**
Generally considered edible but of poor quality. Some sources (Marcel Bon) regard this as a good edible mushroom, but other commentators are less enthusiastic, describing it as poor or not worthwhile. While non-toxic, many guides list it as "edible not worthwhile" due to mediocre flavor and texture.

**Potential Confusion Risk:**
There is potential resemblance to *Paralepistopsis amoenolens*, which is poisonous, though this species seems limited in distribution to North Africa, southern France, and southern Italy. Not believed to occur in UK.

**Similar Species:**
- **Common Funnel** (*Clitocybe gibba*) - Similar appearance but has thicker cap flesh
- **Aniseed Funnel** (*Clitocybe odora*) - Blue-green color, strong aniseed smell

**Key Distinction:** The much thinner cap flesh helps distinguish the Tawny Funnel from the superficially similar Common Funnel. The jug-like appearance with a spouted low point and deeply decurrent gills are characteristic. The pale tawny/orangey color and lack of any strong smell also help identification.

**Ecological Role:**
The Tawny Funnel is saprophytic, helping decompose leaf litter and woody debris in forest ecosystems.

**Note:** Despite being technically edible, the poor flavor means most foragers pass this one by in favor of better species.
