### Lurid Bolete
*Suillellus luridus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:lurid_bolete`
- **Edibility:** Edible ONLY when thoroughly cooked - avoid alcohol
- **Toxicity:** Toxic raw; may cause reactions with alcohol
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Under beech, lime, and oak on chalky soil

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 5
- **Saturation:** 0.7
- **Effects:** None (when properly cooked)

**Identification:**
The Lurid Bolete is a substantial mushroom with a cap 7-20cm across, initially hemispherical, becoming convex. The cap color is variable - can be dark brown, olive-brown, or sometimes with orange tones, with a dry, velvety texture when young. The cap becomes smooth with age.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Stem:** The stout ochre stem reaches 8-14cm tall and 1-3cm wide, patterned with a RED NETWORK (reticulation) - this is the key distinguishing feature
- **Pores:** Yellow/orange when young, becoming more reddish with age, staining dark blue/black when damaged
- **Flesh:** Pallid flesh turns rapidly blue-black on contact with air - this bruising is immediate and dramatic

The underside has pores instead of gills. The entire mushroom bruises blue-black very quickly when cut or damaged.

Found under beech, lime, and oak trees, mainly in areas of chalky/alkaline soil. Fairly frequent throughout Britain and Ireland as well as mainland Europe; occurs most often where the soil is alkaline.

**Culinary Value & Safety:**
Edible ONLY if thoroughly cooked - some sources recommend 20+ minutes of cooking. If eaten raw or insufficiently cooked, it causes gastrointestinal poisoning within 30 minutes to two hours, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.

Known to cause gastric upsets in a relatively high proportion of people even when cooked. Has been suspected of causing enhanced alcohol sensitivity similar to Coprinopsis atramentaria (avoid alcohol before and after consumption).

**Dangerous Lookalikes:**
- **Devil's Bolete** (*Rubroboletus satanas*) - VERY POISONOUS. Very pale lumpy cap, red pores, grows in same habitat
- **Dotted Stem Bolete** (*Neoboletus luridiformis*) - Edible cooked. Has RED DOTS on stem, not a network

**Key Distinction:** The RED NETWORK pattern on the stem distinguishes this from the Dotted Stem Bolete (which has dots). The dark cap distinguishes it from the very pale Devil's Bolete.

**Safety Warning:** Due to the many potentially very toxic look-alikes, the Lurid Bolete should only be collected by very knowledgeable foragers. In some mushroom books, collecting is discouraged entirely. Not recommended for beginners.
