*Russula emetica*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:sickener`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS
- **Toxicity:** Moderate
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-October)
- **Habitat:** Coniferous woodland, especially pine

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0

- **Effects:** Poison II (400 ticks), Confusion I (300 ticks)

**Identification:**
The Sickener is a medium-sized Russula with a brilliant red cap. The cap is 4-10cm across, convex to flat, often with a depressed center. The surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, colored bright cherry-red to scarlet-red, sometimes fading to pinkish. The cap skin peels easily halfway to the center. The gills are white to pale cream, brittle, fairly widely spaced.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, white, cylindrical, firm. The flesh is white, brittle, snapping cleanly like chalk. **Critical feature:** The taste is intensely hot and peppery - this burning, acrid taste appears immediately when a small piece is chewed (spit out - do not swallow).

The Sickener grows in coniferous woodland, particularly with pine, forming mycorrhizal associations. It's one of the hot-tasting Russulas.

**TOXICITY:** Contains unknown irritant compounds that cause:
- Severe vomiting and diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Symptoms appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after eating
- Usually resolves in 6-12 hours
- Not fatal but very unpleasant (hence "Sickener")

**Lookalikes:**
- **Charcoal Burner** (Russula cyanoxantha) - EDIBLE. Variable colors including purple/lilac, mild taste, greasy gills
- Other red Russulas - Many exist; use taste test to determine edibility

**Safety Rule for all Russulas:** Always taste-test (nibble and spit). If hot/peppery, it's inedible. If mild, it's potentially edible (though still confirm species).
