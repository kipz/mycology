### Coconut Milk Cap
*Lactarius glyciosmus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:coconut_milk_cap`
- **Edibility:** Edible (poor quality)
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Late summer to autumn (August-November)
- **Habitat:** Birch woodland, often on acidic soils

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3

**Identification:**
The Coconut Milk Cap has a distinctive cap 2-6cm across, convex at first becoming depressed in the center, often with a small umbo. The cap is pale pinkish-grey to lilac-grey, sometimes with faint concentric zones, and has an inrolled margin when young. The surface is dry to slightly greasy when moist. **Critical feature:** The entire mushroom has a strong, distinctive coconut smell, especially when crushed or dried.

The gills are decurrent (running down the stem), crowded, pale cream to pinkish, and exude white milk (latex) when damaged that does not change color. The stem is 3-7cm tall, cylindrical, colored like the cap or paler, smooth, and often hollow in age. The flesh is thin, pale, and fragile. This species is mycorrhizal with birch trees exclusively.

**Culinary Value:** While technically edible, this mushroom is not recommended for the table. The flesh is thin, fragile, and of poor quality. Some people find the coconut scent appealing, but it diminishes with cooking. Better milk caps are available for culinary purposes.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Lilac Milk Cap** (Lactarius uvidus) - Similar color but lacks coconut smell, grows with willows
- Other small Lactarius species - Check for coconut smell and birch association

**Key Distinction:** The unmistakable strong coconut smell combined with the lilac-grey color and birch habitat makes this species easy to identify.
