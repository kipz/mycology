**Identification:**
Beechwood Sickener is a medium-sized Russula that fruits exclusively under beech trees, hence its common name. The cap is 5-10cm across, convex to flat, colored bright red to cherry red with a paler margin. The cap surface is smooth and slightly greasy when moist, with skin that peels easily partway toward the center. The gills are white to cream, closely spaced, and brittle - a characteristic feature of all Russula species.

The stem is 5-8cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical, and pure white, sometimes flushed pink at the base. The flesh is white, firm, and brittle, snapping cleanly like chalk. **Critical identification feature:** The taste is acrid and peppery (though you should never swallow when taste-testing - immediately spit out). This hot, burning taste is the key characteristic that distinguishes inedible Russulas from edible ones.

Like its relative the Sickener (R. emetica), this species causes severe gastrointestinal distress if eaten, including vomiting and diarrhea - hence the common name. While not lethal, it causes very unpleasant symptoms. The mycorrhizal association is specific to beech (Fagus sylvatica), making it a reliable indicator species.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Sickener** (Russula emetica) - Similar but found with conifers
- **Blackening Brittlegill** (Russula nigricans) - Larger, blackens with age
- Edible red Russulas - These have mild taste, not acrid

**Warning:** Never eat a red Russula unless you are absolutely certain of the species and have confirmed mild taste.
