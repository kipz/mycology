**Identification:**
Bovine Bolete is a small to medium-sized bolete with a somewhat dull appearance compared to its more prized relatives. The cap is 3-10cm across, convex to flat, colored pale yellow-brown to orange-brown or cinnamon, with a smooth surface that becomes very slimy in wet weather. The pore surface is large-pored (compound pores), initially pale yellow, becoming darker greenish-yellow to olive with age. The pores do not bruise blue.

The stem is 4-8cm tall, 0.5-1.5cm thick, equal or slightly swollen at the base, colored similarly to the cap. There is no ring, and the surface is smooth. The flesh is pale yellow, soft and often water-logged, with a faint fruity smell. The taste is mild to slightly acidic. Bovine Bolete forms mycorrhizal associations exclusively with pine trees (Pinus species), particularly Scots pine, often growing in dense troops.

While edible, Bovine Bolete is generally not highly rated due to its soft, watery texture and bland flavor. The slimy cap skin should be removed before cooking. It's best used in mixed mushroom dishes rather than on its own. Young specimens are preferable as older ones become soggy. Not considered choice, but safe and harmless. Often appears alongside the more desirable Slippery Jack.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Slippery Jack** (Suillus luteus) - Has a ring on stem, brown cap
- **Larch Bolete** (Suillus grevillei) - Golden yellow, ring present, with larch
