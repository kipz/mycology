**Identification:**
The Blusher is a medium to large Amanita species that gets its name from the characteristic wine-red or pinkish flush that appears when the flesh is damaged or affected by insects. The cap is 5-15cm across, initially globose, expanding to convex and finally flat. The color is reddish-brown to fawn-brown, typically covered with pinkish-grey to grey-brown warts (remnants of the universal veil). The cap margin is not striated.

The gills are white, crowded, and free from the stem. The stem is 8-15cm tall, 1-3cm thick, whitish with a pinkish flush, especially where damaged. It has a ring (annulus) that is large, pendant, and white with slight striations on the upper surface. The base is bulbous with irregular rings or warts rather than a distinct volva sac. **Critical features:** The flesh bruises reddish, particularly where maggots have been feeding. The stem base often shows wine-red staining.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:** The Blusher is TOXIC when raw, containing the toxin hemolytic hemolysins. It MUST be cooked thoroughly (boiling or frying for at least 15 minutes) to destroy these toxins. Once properly cooked, it's considered a good edible. However, due to its membership in the Amanita genus (which includes the deadly Death Cap and Destroying Angel), extreme caution and expert identification are essential. **Beginners should avoid all Amanitas.**

**Lookalikes:**
- **Panther Cap** (Amanita pantherina) - DEADLY. Grey-brown, pure white ring, marginate volva, does NOT blush red
- **Grey Spotted Amanita** (A. spissa) - Similar but darker, grey staining, not edible
- **Death Cap** (A. phalloides) - DEADLY. Greenish cap, white gills, volva sac

**Warning:** Never eat any Amanita unless you are absolutely certain of identification. When in doubt, throw it out.
