### Suede Bolete
*Xerocomus subtomentosus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:suede_bolete`
- **Edibility:** Edible but poor quality
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Summer to autumn (July-November)
- **Habitat:** Mixed and broadleaf woodland

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.4
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Suede Bolete is a medium-sized mushroom with a cap 4-8cm in diameter when fully expanded. Young caps are hemispherical and downy with a suede-like texture (hence the name), becoming smooth and sometimes cracking as the fruiting bodies mature. The cap is very variable in color - from dark brown to tan to olivaceous to yellow - making color an unreliable identification feature.

**Key identifying features:**
- **Suede-like cap texture** when young (velvety/downy)
- **Yellow pores/tubes:** Chrome yellow, darkening with age, can turn blue where bruised
- **Pale yellow stem:** 5-10cm long, 1-2cm diameter, usually pale yellow with a pink/brown base
- **Flesh:** White becoming yellow-tinged on exposure to air

The tubes and pores are chrome yellow, turning blue where bruised but not dramatically. The stem has no ring and no reticulation (network pattern).

This bolete is common throughout the British Isles in mixed and broadleaf woodland, particularly under oak and beech. It forms mycorrhizal relationships with a wide range of hardwood and conifer trees. Fruits in autumn.

**Culinary Value:**
The Suede Bolete is edible but not highly regarded. It must be cooked but has poor flavor and texture compared to other boletes. It's often described as bland or insipid. Used mostly to bulk out a mixed mushroom dish rather than as a feature ingredient. The flavor and texture can be improved by drying - dried Suede Boletes can be stored and rehydrated later for use in soups and stews.

**Similar Species:**
- **Bay Bolete** (*Imleria badia*) - Better eating, darker bay-brown cap, stronger blue bruising
- **Red Cracking Bolete** (*Xerocomellus chrysenteron*) - Cap develops red-stained cracks

**Key Distinction:** The suede-like texture of young caps, variable coloration, and relatively mild blue bruising of the pores help identify this species. The yellow pores and absence of red staining distinguish it from related species.

**Additional Notes:**
While this mushroom won't make you sick, it also won't impress your dinner guests. It's one of those "technically edible but not really worth it" mushrooms. Better boletes to hunt for include Cep/Penny Bun (*Boletus edulis*) or Bay Bolete (*Imleria badia*).
