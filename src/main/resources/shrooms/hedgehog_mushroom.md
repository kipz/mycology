**Identification:**
Hedgehog Mushroom is an excellent edible species with a distinctive feature that makes it virtually impossible to confuse with anything toxic - it has spines instead of gills or pores. The cap is 4-12cm across, irregular in shape, convex to flat with a wavy, lobed margin. The surface is smooth, dry, colored pale cream to pale orange or peachy-buff.

**Diagnostic feature:** The underside is covered with soft, brittle spines (teeth) 3-6mm long that are cream to pale buff colored and easily detach from the cap. These spines run slightly down the stem. No toxic mushrooms have this spine structure, making Hedgehog a safe beginner's mushroom.

The stem is 3-8cm tall, 1-3cm thick, off-center or central, white to pale cream, solid. The flesh is thick, white, firm, brittle, with a pleasant mild smell and taste. Hedgehog Mushroom forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees in deciduous and coniferous woodland, often growing in troops.

**Culinary Value:** Highly regarded edible mushroom with a firm texture and slightly nutty, peppery flavor. The spines should be gently scraped off before cooking as they can be slightly bitter. Excellent sautéed in butter, in cream sauces, soups, or with eggs. The firm flesh holds up well to cooking. Can be dried successfully.

**Lookalikes:**
None with spines - this feature is unique and diagnostic. There are other toothed fungi but none that could be confused with this.

**Foraging Tip:** Often found in the same areas as chanterelles and porcini. A reliable and safe species for beginners.
