### Tiger Sawgill
*Lentinus tigrinus*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:tiger_sawgill`
- **Edibility:** Edible but tough
- **Toxicity:** None - toxicologically safe
- **Season:** Late spring to autumn (May-October)
- **Habitat:** Waterlogged rotting wood, especially willows

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 3
- **Saturation:** 0.5
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Tiger Sawgill is a small to medium mushroom named for its distinctive appearance. The cap is 2-8cm across, white to cream with brown to dark brown scales arranged in a pattern resembling tiger stripes - the specific epithet "*tigrinus*" means 'like a tiger' and refers to these scaly stripes.

**Critical identifying features:**
- **Tiger-stripe scales:** Dark brown scales on a pale background
- **Sawgill teeth:** The gills have toothed/serrated edges (hence "sawgill") - you can feel the teeth if you run your finger along the gill edge
- **Decurrent gills:** The gills run down the stem
- **Aquatic habitat:** Typically grows from wood partially submerged in water

The stem is 2-6cm tall, 3-8mm thick, similarly colored and scaled as the cap, central or slightly off-center, tough and fibrous. The flesh is white, tough, and leathery.

An uncommon to rare find in Britain and Ireland, the Tiger Sawgill is seen only infrequently, mainly from central and southern England. It grows on waterlogged rotting branches of deciduous hardwood trees, particularly willows. Look for it on fallen branches in streams, ponds, or very wet woodland areas.

**Culinary Value:**
The caps are reported to be edible, but the stems are tough and should be dried and powdered for use. While not toxic (biosafety studies confirm it's toxicologically safe), this mushroom is generally not considered a choice edible due to its tough texture. The Tiger Sawgill is a cousin to the widely cultivated Shiitake and is currently being researched for its ease of cultivation, rapid life cycle, and similarity in flavor to the woodsy Shiitake.

**Similar Species:**
- **Lentinellus* species have toothed gill edges but different habitat and appearance
- Scaled mushrooms on wood, but few grow in waterlogged conditions

**Key Distinction:** The combination of tiger-stripe scales, toothed gill edges (sawgill), decurrent gills, and growth on waterlogged wood make this species distinctive. The aquatic/semi-aquatic habitat is particularly diagnostic - few UK mushrooms favor such wet conditions.

**Cultivation Potential:**
Currently being studied for cultivation as a Shiitake-like culinary and medicinal mushroom. Shows promise for commercial production.
