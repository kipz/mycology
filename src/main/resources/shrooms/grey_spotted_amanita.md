**Identification:**
Grey Spotted Amanita is a robust Amanita that is not toxic but easily confused with poisonous species. The cap is 5-12cm across, convex to flat, grey-brown to dark brown, covered with irregular grey to grey-brown warts or patches. The gills are white, free, crowded. The stem is 7-15cm tall, stout, white to grey, with grey-brown staining especially toward base. There is a white ring and a bulbous base with irregular ridges rather than a distinct volva.

The flesh is white, staining grey, with no distinctive smell. This species bruises and stains grey rather than red (unlike the edible Blusher).

**WARNING:** While not poisonous, this mushroom is best avoided due to easy confusion with the toxic Panther Cap and other dangerous Amanitas. Not recommended for consumption.

**Lookalikes:**
- **Panther Cap** (Amanita pantherina) - DEADLY. Pure white ring, marginate volva, does not stain
- **Blusher** (Amanita rubescens) - Edible when cooked. Stains red not grey
