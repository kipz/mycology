### Scarlet Waxcap
*Hygrocybe coccinea*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:scarlet_waxcap`
- **Edibility:** Edible but conservation concern - DO NOT PICK
- **Toxicity:** None
- **Season:** Autumn to early winter (September-December)
- **Habitat:** Unimproved grassland, old pastures

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 2
- **Saturation:** 0.3
- **Effects:** None

**Identification:**
The Scarlet Waxcap is a beautiful small to medium mushroom with a cap 2-5cm across. The cap is bright red to orange-red, sometimes fading to yellowish at the edges with age. The cap surface is smooth, slightly sticky when wet, and convex when young, flattening out with maturity. When young and wet, the cap is slimy.

The gills are waxy in texture (hence "waxcap"), adnate or slightly decurrent, relatively well-spaced, and colored similarly to the cap (red to orange-red), sometimes with yellow edges. The stem is 3-7cm tall, 5-10mm thick, cylindrical, smooth, colored like the cap or paler (yellow to orange), and can be slightly sticky.

The Scarlet Waxcap is typically found in unimproved grasslands, including pastures, meadows, and mossy lawns that have not been treated with fertilizers or pesticides. It prefers nutrient-poor soils. They normally fruit between September and December.

**Conservation Status:**
Although the Scarlet Waxcap is edible with a mild (though unremarkable) flavor, habitat destruction means this is now a relatively uncommon mushroom. **Collection for consumption is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED** due to conservation concerns.

The Scarlet Waxcap is a key indicator of biodiversity in grassland ecosystems, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and undisturbed habitats. Its presence is a sign of high conservation value in grasslands. Waxcap grasslands are priority habitats for conservation.

**Similar Species:**
- **Crimson Waxcap** (*Hygrocybe punicea*) - Typically larger, darker red cap, much less common
- Other red-capped waxcaps require very close examination for accurate identification

**Key Distinction:** The bright red to orange-red color, waxy gill texture, sticky cap when wet, and habitat in old unimproved grassland are characteristic. However, red waxcaps are difficult to identify to species level without experience.

**Important Message:**
While technically edible, PLEASE DO NOT PICK waxcaps. These beautiful mushrooms are indicators of ancient, species-rich grassland - one of our most threatened habitats. Their delicate size and mild flavor make them poor food anyway. Enjoy them with your eyes and camera instead!

**Ecological Importance:**
Waxcaps are thought to be saprophytic (feeding on dead plant material) or possibly forming unusual associations with mosses. Their exact ecology is still being researched, but they're indicators of old, undisturbed grassland of high ecological value.
