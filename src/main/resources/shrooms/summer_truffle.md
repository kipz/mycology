**Identification:**
The Summer Truffle (also called Burgundy Truffle) is a subterranean fungus that grows entirely underground. The fruiting bodies are roughly ball-shaped, up to 10cm in diameter. **Critical identifying features:** The skin (peridium) is black and covered in a network of pyramid-shaped 'warts', giving the whole body a rough, bark-like texture.

**Interior:** When cut open, the flesh is pale brown to greyish with white veining forming a marbled pattern. The flesh is firm.

**Smell:** Characteristic nutty/mushroom type smell - less intense than the famous Périgord truffle but still aromatic and distinctive. The aroma is hazelnut-like and earthy.

**Habitat:** Grows in mycorrhizal relationship with the root systems of Beech trees on lime-rich (alkaline/chalky) soil. Found entirely underground, usually 5-20cm deep.

**UK Distribution:** The Summer Truffle was plentiful in the United Kingdom prior to the 20th century but is now a rare find in the UK and Ireland. More common throughout continental Europe. Known to occur in southern England, particularly in areas with beech woodland on chalk.

**Culinary Value:**
Summer Truffles are highly-prized edible fungi valued by chefs worldwide. They have a lovely hazelnut-nutty, fungal flavor that is less intense than a Périgord truffle. Used shaved fresh over pasta, risotto, eggs, or incorporated into sauces and butters. The flavor is delicate and earthy. Even a small amount can elevate a dish significantly.

**Hunting Truffles:**
Truffles are traditionally hunted using trained dogs or pigs that can smell the underground fruiting bodies. They're usually found 5-20cm below the surface near the base of beech trees. Look for areas where little vegetation grows around beech trees on chalky soil - this "brûlé" (burnt area) can indicate truffle presence.

**Similar Species:**
- **Autumn Truffle** (*Tuber uncinatum*) - Very similar, harvested later (September-December), some consider it the same species
- Other *Tuber* species require expert identification

**Conservation Note:**
Given their rarity in the UK, consider the conservation implications before harvesting. Some estates actively cultivate truffle orchards.

**Key Distinction:** Black warty exterior, underground growth, association with beech on chalky soil, and characteristic nutty aroma are diagnostic. True truffles are always subterranean - if it grows above ground, it's not a truffle.
