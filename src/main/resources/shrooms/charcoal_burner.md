**Identification:**
Charcoal Burner is considered one of the best edible Russula species in the UK. The cap is 5-15cm across, convex to flattened, often with a slight central depression. **The color is highly variable** - it can be purple, lilac, blue-grey, olive-green, or a mixture of these colors, often with different zones. This variability led to the species being confused for many different Russulas until microscopy confirmed they were all the same. The cap surface is smooth, slightly greasy when wet, with skin that peels halfway to the center.

The gills are the key identifying feature: they are white to cream, crowded, and **feel greasy or waxy to the touch** - this is unique among UK Russulas and is diagnostic. If you run your finger gently across the gills, they feel soft and flexible rather than brittle like other Russulas. The stem is 5-12cm tall, 1.5-3cm thick, white, solid, and firm. The flesh is white, firm, and **tastes mild** (not peppery) - this mild taste is critical for confirming edibility.

Charcoal Burner forms mycorrhizal associations with various deciduous trees, particularly oak and beech. The common name supposedly refers to the colors resembling iridescent charcoal. This is one of the safest Russulas to identify due to the combination of variable colors, greasy gills, and mild taste.

**Culinary Value:** Excellent eating mushroom with firm texture and good flavor. Can be cooked in any way - sautéed, grilled, or added to mixed mushroom dishes. The firm flesh holds up well to cooking.

**Lookalikes:**
- Other Russulas - Check gills (greasy feel is unique) and taste (must be mild, not acrid)
- Purple/violet Russulas - Will have brittle gills and may have peppery taste

**Safety Check:** Always confirm mild taste (nibble and spit - do not swallow until certain) and greasy gill texture.
