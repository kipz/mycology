**Identification:**
The Terracotta Hedgehog is a choice edible mushroom named for its terracotta/orange-brown color and spiny undersurface. The cap is 3-8cm across, terracotta to orange-brown in color, becoming lighter towards the edge. The cap has an almost 'woolly' or velvety texture and is irregular in shape, often with an uneven surface.

**Critical identifying feature:** Like other hedgehog mushrooms, it has spines/teeth hanging from the undersurface of the cap instead of gills or pores. These spines are off-white to pale pink in color, quite delicate and brittle.

The stem is quite short and stout, roughly central, 3-6cm tall, 1-2cm thick, off-white to pale pink, smooth or slightly scurfy. The flesh is white to pale, firm but brittle, with a mild pleasant smell.

An easy-to-identify mushroom with few lookalikes. Common in UK coniferous and mixed woodlands. Forms mycorrhizal associations with pine, spruce, beech, and oak trees.

**Culinary Value:**
Terracotta Hedgehogs are a popular edible species and should be picked while young and free from worms and grubs. They retain their firm texture when cooked and have a nutty, slightly spicy flavor. They work well in most mushroom dishes and are excellent as a standalone mushroom or feature ingredient. The firm texture holds up well to various cooking methods.

There are no known hazards at time of writing - this is a safe mushroom for beginners.

**Preparation:**
The spines should be brushed clean. Some people prefer to remove the spines before cooking, though this isn't necessary. The mushrooms can be sautéed, fried, added to stews, or preserved by drying.

**Similar Species:**
- **Wood Hedgehog** (*Hydnum repandum*) - EDIBLE. Larger, cream-colored (not terracotta), same spiny undersurface
- No poisonous lookalikes exist in UK

**Key Distinction:** The terracotta/orange color combined with the spiny undersurface makes this mushroom unmistakable. If you find a light-colored mushroom growing from the ground with a stem and spines (not gills or pores), it's a hedgehog mushroom - and they're all edible. The terracotta color distinguishes this species from the larger, cream-colored Wood Hedgehog.

**Beginner-Friendly:**
This is an excellent mushroom for novice foragers. The combination of distinctive features (terracotta color, spiny undersurface) and lack of poisonous lookalikes makes it a safe choice for those learning to forage.
