*Chlorophyllum molybdites*

**Quick Reference:**
- **Item ID:** `mycology:deadly_parasol`
- **Edibility:** POISONOUS (Not native to UK)
- **Toxicity:** Moderate to Severe
- **Season:** Summer to autumn
- **Habitat:** Grassland, gardens (rare in UK)

**In-Game Properties:**
- **Nutrition:** 0
- **Saturation:** 0.0
- **Effects:** Wither II (600 ticks), Poison III (1000 ticks)

**Identification:**
**NOTE: This species is not native to the UK but is included due to its importance in mushroom poisonings worldwide and potential introduction via imported materials.**

Deadly Parasol (also called Green-spored Parasol or False Parasol) closely resembles edible Parasol mushrooms. The cap is 10-30cm across, initially hemispherical, expanding to flat with a low umbo. The surface is white to cream covered with brown to pinkish-brown scales that are denser at the center. The gills start white but turn **greenish-grey to grey-green as spores mature** - this green color is diagnostic and differentiates it from true Parasols.

The stem is 10-25cm tall, 1-2cm thick, cylindrical with a bulbous base, white to pale brown below. It has a large, movable, double-edged ring. The flesh is white but may discolor slightly when cut. The spore print is distinctive **green to grey-green**.

**TOXICITY:** This species is responsible for the most mushroom poisonings in North America. It contains toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal distress:
- Symptoms appear 1-3 hours after eating
- Severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea
- Symptoms can be extremely severe and may require hospitalization
- Usually resolves in 24-48 hours but can be dangerous for elderly, young, or those with health conditions
- NOT fatal in most cases but highly unpleasant

**Lookalikes:**
- **Parasol** (Macrolepiota procera) - EDIBLE. White to cream spores, not green, different ring structure
- **Shaggy Parasol** (Chlorophyllum rhacodes) - EDIBLE with caution. No green gills, bruises orange-red

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** **Always check the gills of large parasol-like mushrooms**. If they have any hint of green or grey-green, AVOID. Always take a spore print to confirm - edible parasols have white to cream spores, never green.
