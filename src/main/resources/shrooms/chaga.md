**Identification:**
Chaga is one of the most unusual-looking fungi, forming large, irregular, black charcoal-like masses on the trunks of birch trees. The exterior is black, deeply cracked, and resembles burnt wood or charcoal, giving it the appearance of a tumor on the tree. The masses can be 25-40cm across and up to 50cm long. The interior is a rusty yellow-brown color with a corky or woody texture.

Unlike most bracket fungi, Chaga is not the fruiting body but a sterile conk - the actual fruiting occurs in a thin layer under the bark. Chaga is a parasitic fungus causing white rot in birch trees, eventually killing the host. It takes many years to develop substantial growth, typically appearing on trees that are at least 40 years old. The growth continues for 10-20+ years before the tree dies.

**Medicinal Properties:** Chaga has been used for centuries in Russian and Northern European folk medicine. Modern research has shown it contains numerous bioactive compounds:
- Extremely high in antioxidants (highest ORAC score of any natural food)
- Betulinic acid (from the birch tree)
- Polysaccharides with immune-modulating effects
- Anti-inflammatory compounds
- Potentially anti-cancer properties (ongoing research)

**Preparation:** Chaga is too woody to eat. It's typically harvested, dried, and made into tea by simmering chunks in hot water for several hours. The tea has a mild, slightly vanilla-like flavor. **Sustainable harvesting:** Only take from trees that are already dead or dying, leave at least 30% of the conk, and never strip it down to bare wood.

**WARNING:** Do not consume if taking blood-thinning medications or before surgery, as it has anticoagulant properties.
